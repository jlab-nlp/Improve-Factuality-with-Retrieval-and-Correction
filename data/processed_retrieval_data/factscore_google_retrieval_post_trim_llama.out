(2005), Capital Scandal (2007),  Hong Gil-dong (2008), Lie to Me (2011), Incarnation of Money (2013), Big Man (2014) and Children of a Lesser God (2018) as well as the films Rough Cut (2008) and My Girlfriend Is an Agent (2009).

2002–2005: Beginnings and rising popularity
Jo Tae-gyu made his acting debut in musical theatre in 2002, in the Korean stagings of popular musicals The Rocky Horror Show and Grease. From 2003 to 2004, using the stage name Kang Ji-hwan, he began appearing in small roles on television, which included the sitcom Nonstop 4 and the Korean dramas Summer Scent and Save the Last Dance for Me.
2005–2008: First fame film roles and commercial peak
Kang shot to fame in 2005 with Be Strong, Geum-soon!, in his first onscreen leading role as a fastidious doctor who falls for a widowed hairdresser (played by Han Hye-jin).[1] The drama increased his pan-Asian popularity, particularly in Japan,[2] China, and Taiwan. He then made his big screen debut in the role of a Jehovah's Witness who befriends an unemployed professor in the independent film Host and Guest, which traveled the international film festival circuit.[3][4]
Kang continued acting on television but his 2006 dramas Fireworks, about two cosmetics firm employees who plot revenge against their exes (opposite Han Chae-young),[5] and 90 Days, Time to Love, about a terminally ill married man who's in love with his cousin (opposite Kim Ha-neul), received low viewership ratings. In 2007, he and Han Ji-min starred in Capital Scandal, a period drama adapted from Lee Sun-mi's novel set in Japanese-occupied Korea.[6] His portrayal of a carefree playboy who transforms into an independence fighter garnered positive reviews.[7]
2008 became a successful year for Kang. He was cast as the titular Joseon folk hero in Hong Gil-dong, written by the Hong sisters. Kang said his portrayal was inspired by Stephen Chow, and the fusion-period-dramedy became a TV cult hit.[8] Later that year, he also starred in Rough Cut, a low-budget film directed by Jang Hoon and written by Kim Ki-duk about a gangster who wants to become an actor and a hot-tempered star who acts like a thug.[9] Kang and costar So Ji-sub were praised for their performances, and both won several Best New Actor awards.
2009–2012: Commercial success and comeback in film
Kang then reunited with previous leading lady Kim Ha-neul in My Girlfriend Is an Agent, a 2009 action-romantic comedy in which their characters are former lovers and spies trying to conceal their professions from each other.[10] It became the fourth highest grossing Korean film of that year, with more than 4 million tickets sold.[11] Afterwards, he played a looks-oriented architect whose eye problem magically causes him to see the homely heroine (played by Lee Ji-ah) as beautiful in The Relation of Face, Mind and Love, a "telecinema" which received a brief theatrical release and a TV run.[7][12]
In 2010, Kang starred in romantic comedy series Coffee House, in which he played an eccentric novelist who is caught in a love triangle with his publisher (played by Park Si-yeon) and his assistant (played by Ham Eun-jung).[13][14][15] This was followed by his return to the stage in the musical revival Cafe In, a love story between a male sommelier and a female barista. Kang produced the show's Korean and Japanese runs, and he also starred in the latter, becoming the first Korean actor to perform at the Tokyo Globe Theatre.[16][17][18]
Kang and Yoon Eun-hye then starred in 2011's Lie to Me, playing a hotelier and a civil servant who fake being married to each other after she tells a white lie that quickly spreads through the gossip channels.[19][20]
The 2012 comedy film Runway Cop reunited him with previous costar Sung Yu-ri (from Hong Gil-dong) and director Shin Tae-ra (from My Girlfriend Is an Agent).[21][22] During filming, Kang gained 12 kilograms and shed 15 kilograms two weeks later for his role as an overweight and messy detective who goes undercover as a fashion runway model to solve a case.[23][24][25][26][27] Following that, he and Lee Ki-woo appeared in a 25-minute "music video drama" to promote Kim Hyung-jun's EP Escape.[28]
2013–2015: Success roles
In 2013, Kang starred in Incarnation of Money, in the role of a prosecutor with ties to a loan shark.[29][30] Then in 2014's Big Man, he played a "good-for-nothing" orphan who is tricked into thinking that he is the long-lost eldest son of a wealthy tycoon's family, when they only want to harvest his heart for a transplant.[31][32][33][34][35][36]
Kang and Yoon Jin-seo shot the gangster love story Heartbreak Hotel in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and the indie was released in 2015.[37] He was next cast in the Korean-Chinese romantic comedy A-lister Fall from the Sky, about a scandal-ridden Hallyu star who goes to China and encounters his biggest fan (played by Jiang Yuan).[38][39]
2016–2017: Other films and later popularity
Kang reunited with Hong Gil-dong and Runaway Cop co-star Sung Yu-ri in revenge melodrama Monster, which aired in 2016.[40][41] In 2018, Kang starred in his first cable drama Children of a Lesser God, playing a genius detective.[42][43] The same year, he starred in the workplace comedy Feel Good to Die.[44][45]
2018–2020: Focus on roles and other works
In 2019, Kang starred in the series Joseon Survival Period, but due to sexual assault allegations against him, he was replaced by Seo Ji-seok from episode 11 onward.[46][47][48]
Contract disputes
In 2010, Kang was sued for breach of contract by his former talent agency Jambo Entertainment. Kang had signed with S-Plus Entertainment after asking to be released from his contract with Jambo, which the latter claimed was still valid for eight months.[49] S-Plus stated that of the six years that Kang was with Jambo, he was without a contract for three years, and after receiving no response from their overtures regarding Jambo's "unfair terms," they took steps to legally terminate Kang's contract.[50][51] Upon mediation, the Corea Entertainment Management Association (CEMA) instructed Kang to suspend his entertainment activities for eight months, but when he starred in Coffee House anyway, CEMA members threatened to boycott him unless he dropped out of playing the leading role in Faith.[52][53]
In 2012, S-Plus Entertainment moved to extend Kang's contract with them for an additional eight months, citing his lack of projects for that same length of time due to CEMA's edict. When Kang refused and began entrusting his business affairs to his lawyer, S-Plus sued him for breach of contract.[53][54][55] In 2013, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the lawsuit and upheld the validity of the original contract; the court also ordered S-Plus to pay Kang ₩5 million in damages after the agency defamed him in the press.[56]
Sexual assault allegations
Arrest and sexual content disputes
On July 9, 2019, Kang was arrested over allegations that he sexually molested and assaulted two of his agency's female employees at his home. Kang stated that he remembered drinking with them but did not remember what happened afterwards.[57][58] Kang’s agency, Huayi Brothers, issued an apology and sought another actor to replace Kang in his ongoing TV series.[59][48] On July 15, 2019, Kang admitted to all charges against him and apologized to the victims.[60][61] Following this, Huayi Brothers terminated their contract with Kang on July 16, 2019 and he decided to retire from the entertainment industry.[62] On July 26, 2019, Kang was indicted with the criminal charges of quasi-rape and quasi-indecent acts by force.[63] During the first trial, in September 2019, it was revealed that Kang had offered the victims a settlement before the trial, but they rejected it.[64]
On December 5, 2019, Kang was found guilty and sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, suspended for three years of probation, by the Suwon District Court. Kang was also ordered to conduct 120 hours of social service, take part in 40 hours of sexual offender treatment and be restricted from employment for three years.[65]

Known for her unconventional body of work, she is the recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award, a Filmfare Award, and two Screen Awards. Although a French citizen, she has been raised and lived most of her life in India.
Born in Pondicherry, India, Koechlin was drawn to theatre from a young age. She studied drama at Goldsmiths, University of London, and worked simultaneously with a local theatre company. After returning to India, she made her Hindi film debut as Chanda in the black comedy-drama Dev.D (2009), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Subsequently, she starred in two of the highest-grossing Hindi films of their respective release years, the romantic comedy-dramas Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), both of which garnered her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Koechlin expanded her career into screenwriting with the crime thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011), in which she also played the lead role.
Koechlin's commercial success continued with the supernatural thriller Ek Thi Daayan (2013) and the musical drama Gully Boy (2019), while also receiving critical praise for her performances in independent films, including the comedy-drama Waiting (2015) and the slice-of-life film Ribbon (2017). She earned high acclaim and the National Film Award – Special Jury Award for her role of a young woman with cerebral palsy in the coming-of-age drama Margarita with a Straw (2014). Koechlin made a transition to web content in the late 2010s, starring in a spate of successful web series.

Koechlin is also an activist and promotes various causes ranging from health and education to women empowerment and gender equality.
Early life and background
Kalki Koechlin was born in Pondicherry, India,[1] on 10 January 1984[2][3] to French parents, Joël Koechlin and Françoise Armandie, who came to India from Angers, France, after adopting Hinduism.[1] She is a descendant of Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer who played an important role in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower.[4] Koechlin's parents are devotees of Sri Aurobindo, and she spent a significant amount of her early childhood in Auroville.[1][5] The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty, Tamil Nadu, where Koechlin's father established a business designing hang-gliders and ultralight aircraft.[4][6]
Koechlin was brought up in a strict environment in Ooty where she spoke English, Tamil, and French.[7][8] Her parents divorced when she was fifteen; her father moved to Bangalore and remarried, while Koechlin continued living with her mother.[7] She has described the time that she spent at Kallatty between the ages of 5 and 8, before her parents' divorce, as her "happiest".[9] Koechlin has a half-brother from her mother's previous marriage, and a half-brother from her father's subsequent marriage.[7]
Koechlin studied at Hebron School, a boarding school in Ooty, where she was involved in acting and writing. She has admitted to being shy and quiet as a child.[10] Koechlin aspired to study psychiatry and become a criminal psychologist.[11] After completing her schooling at the age of 18, she moved to London and studied drama and theatre at Goldsmiths, University of London. There, she worked for two years with the theatre company Theatre of Relativity, writing The Rise of the Wild Hunt and performing in plays such as David Hare's The Blue Room and Marivaux's The Dispute.[7][12] She worked as a waitress on weekends.[6]
After completing her studies, Koechlin moved back to India and lived with her maternal half-brother in Bangalore. Unable to find work there, she moved to Mumbai, where she worked with theatre directors and with Atul Kumar and Ajay Krishnan, the founders of a Mumbai-based theatre company called "The Company Theatre". They were looking for actors for a theatrical festival, Contacting the World, to be held in Liverpool.[1][13]
Film career
Acting debut and initial work (2009–10)
After moving to Mumbai, Koechlin auditioned for Anurag Kashyap's black comedy-drama Dev.D (2009), a modern-day adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's 1917 Bengali novel Devdas.[14] Starring alongside Abhay Deol and Mahie Gill, Koechlin plays the role of Leni / Chanda, a young woman who turns to prostitution after a leaked sex tape scandal. The character was based on Chandramukhi, a pivotal character in the novel, a prostitute who fell in love with the titular character.[15] Kashyap initially rejected Koechlin as she was not Indian, and did not match his visualisation of the character, but he changed his mind and offered her the role after seeing her audition tape.[16] The film opened to positive reviews from critics upon release, with particular praise for Koechlin's performance, which was described as "imbued [...] with a touching fragility"[17] and "astonishingly [appropriate]".[18][19] Critics were more impressed by her character's complexity, but thought of Koechlin's performance in the film's first half as "amateurish".[20][21] Moreover, it emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, earning ₹208 million worldwide.[22][23] Koechlin's performance in the film earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.
Koechlin's only film appearance of 2010 was in a supporting role in the black comedy The Film Emotional Atyachar. Co-starring Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak and Ravi Kishan among others, the film opened to mixed-t-negative reviews from critics, as did Koechlin's performance as a manipulative woman who is abducted by two corrupt policemen.[24][25] Komal Nahta of Koimoi labelled her performance as "strictly average", while Blessyy Chettiar of Daily News and Analysis felt that she was underused.[25][26] Koechlin was next committed to star in I am Afia, one of the four segments of Onir's anthology film I Am, but it went into production with a modified plot for the segment.[27] In an interview with The Telegraph, Onir said, "as we discussed the subject more and more, both Koechlin and me felt that the narrative was becoming too hurried in the 25-minute limit".[27] Koechlin, who was to play the role of an NGO  worker in the film was ultimately replaced by Nandita Das, after the change of plot.[27][28]
Breakthrough and commercial success (2011–14)
After facing some early struggle for film roles, Koechlin had four film releases in 2011, garnering widespread praise for her performances in them.[6] The first was Bejoy Nambiar's crime thriller Shaitan, alongside an ensemble cast of Rajeev Khandelwal, Gulshan Devaiah, Shiv Panditt, Neil Bhoopalam, Kirti Kulhari, Rajit Kapoor, Pawan Malhotra and Rajkummar Rao.[29] Based on the 2007 murder of Adnan Patrawala incident, the film told the story of five friends who get embroiled in a crime. She played the role of a disturbed teenager and called it an "exhausting experience", saying that she felt drained while trying to, "get into a psyche of someone who does a lot of drugs and booze, has lost her mind a little bit and is very vulnerable".[30] The film opened to positive reviews from critics upon release, with high praise for Koechlin's performance, with Raja Sen calling her "an increasingly striking actress".[31][32] It emerged as a moderate commercial success at the box-office, grossing ₹390 million worldwide.[33] Koechlin's performance in the film earned her a first nomination for the Screen Award for Best Actress.[34]
Koechlin next starred in Zoya Akhtar's ensemble coming-of-age romantic comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara alongside an ensemble cast of Hrithik Roshan, Deol, Farhan Akhtar and Katrina Kaif. Akhtar had expressed her wish to work with Koechlin in a prior interview with NDTV, having seen her in Dev.D and the then-unreleased That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011).[35][36] Revolving around the story of three childhood friends who take a three-week road trip in Spain, the film saw her portray a South Bombay interior designer, who is slightly posessive of her fiance. Koechlin, who took diction classes for the role which required her to speak accented Hindi, revealed that she was keen to do the film because her work in such projects as Dev.D and Shaitan had led her to being typecast in dark roles of prostitutes, troubled teenagers, and social misfits.[1][37] The film received to widespread critical acclaim upon release, with high praise directed towards Koechlin's performance. Gaurav Malani of The Times of India deemed her "excellent", and Raja Sen in his review for Rediff.com noted her as "histrionically strong enough to manage varied roles".[38][39] With worldwide collections of ₹1.53 billion (US$19 million), Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara emerged as a major blockbuster at the box-office, ranking as the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year and one of the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time.[40][41] The film earned Koechlin her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[42]
Koechlin expanded her career into screenwriting with Kashyap's crime thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots. She said that Kashyap asked her to write the script for the film as he was looking for a woman's perspective for the story.[1] Co-starring alongside Naseeruddin Shah, the film saw her play a British woman who travels to Mumbai in search of her biological father. The role was partially based on her own experience as a 'white-girl' in India.[43] Shot in a short duration of thirteen days, the film was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and the 67th Venice International Film Festival, among other venues.[44][45] It opened to critical acclaim, with Koechlin receiving high praise for her performance. Giving the film 3.5 stars out of 4, Roger Ebert wrote that Koechlin "creates a memorable woman who is sad and old beyond her years".[46] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com describe

William PostBorn(1927-06-27)June 27, 1927Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.DiedFebruary 10, 2024(2024-02-10) (aged 96)Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.Spouse
William Post (June 27, 1927 – February 10, 2024) was an American businessman and inventor. Born to Dutch immigrants and raised in Michigan, Post became the plant manager for Hekman Biscuit company, a cookie company he worked for since he was sixteen years old. As plant manager, he was approached by Kellogg's to create a toaster pastry which later became known as the Pop-Tart, gaining credit for leading the team that invented the confection.[1][2] He eventually became senior vice president of Keebler's until his retirement at age 56. After he retired, Post worked as a consultant and brand ambassador until 2003.
Early life
Post was born on June 27, 1927, to Henry Post and Johanna Jongsta in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[1] His parents were poor Dutch immigrants and his father worked as a truck driver, carrying out used ashes from coal furnaces.[3] Post's family lived on the south side of Grand Rapids and he attended high school at Grand Rapids Christian High School.[1][4] At the age of 16, Post washed trucks part-time for Hekman Biscuit Company, a cookie company which would later become part of Keebler.[1][5] After graduating high school in 1945, he was drafted one year later into the US Army Air Corps and served in occupied Japan.[1] When Post returned to Michigan, he attended Calvin College[a] for two years then returned to his job at Hekman Biscuit Company.[5][3] Post became the plant manager of the company at the age of 21, managing all aspects of the business.[2][5]
Pop-Tarts
In September 1963, Kellogg's approached Post asking if his plant could produce a toaster pastry to compete with rival Post (no relation) which was creating one of their own.[6] Although his boss did not take the idea seriously, he allowed Post to pursue the project.[7] Post told Kellogg's he could have something in two weeks. Post and his team rapidly developed the recipe, which he refined by bringing samples home for his children to test almost daily.[1] According to Post, he "had to break every rule in the book", developing about ten thousand samples in his laboratory by hand.[7] The pastries were initially called "fruit scones" but the name was changed to "Pop-Tarts", an allusion to the pop art trend at the time.[1] The first batch of Pop-Tarts was released to grocery stores in 1964 in Cleveland, Ohio, and quickly sold out.[8]
In 1967, Post thought icing would be an ideal addition to the product. Some people at the company believed that toasting would cause the icing to melt, but it did not.[1][3] That same year, Post moved to Illinois to work at Keebler's corporate office, eventually becoming senior vice president. He retired at the age of 56. He worked as a consultant and brand ambassador for Kellogg's for another 20 years.[1][4] He helped develop a number of other products including Nutri-Grain bars and Rice Krispies Treats.[9]
After Kellogg's acquired Keebler in 2001, Post and his wife moved back to Grand Rapids two years later.[5] Throughout his life, Post maintained that the Pop-Tart's creation was a team effort, stating, "I assembled an amazing team that developed Kellogg's concept of a shelf-stable toaster pastry into a fine product that we could bring to market in the span of just four months".[7]
Later life
In his retirement, Post would visit schools to tell his story to students, telling them how he, the son of immigrants, attained success through hard work. According to his son, he would always tell students "If you want to be noticed, always do more than is expected". He would then give students samples from his unlimited supply of Pop-Tarts.[1] He had a stockpile of them in his car, which had the license plate POPTART.[9]
Post was married to his wife Florence for 72 years until her death in 2020. They had two children.[1][5] Post died of heart failure on February 10, 2024, at the age of 96.[1][5]

William Arthur Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill PC (/ˈwɔːlɡreɪv/; born 15 August 1946) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as a Cabinet minister from 1990 until 1997, and is a life member of the Tory Reform Group. Since 1999, he has been a life peer in the House of Lords. Since 8 February 2009, Lord Waldegrave has been the Provost of Eton College. Additionally, he was inaugurated as Chancellor of the University of Reading on 9 December 2016.[1]
Waldegrave's 2015 memoir, A Different Kind of Weather, discusses his high youthful political ambition, his political and to some extent personal life, and growing acceptance that he would not achieve his ultimate ambition. It also provides an account of the Heath, Thatcher and—to a lesser extent—Major governments, including his role in the development of the 'community charge' or poll tax. It includes a chapter entitled 'The Poll Tax – all my own work'.[2]
Waldegrave served as a Trustee (1992–2011) and Chair (2002–2011) of the Rhodes Trust, during which time he also helped to create and served as a Trustee of the Mandela Rhodes Foundation. His portrait hangs at Rhodes House, Oxford.[3]
He was the Chairman of Trustees of the National Museum of Science and Industry from 2002 to 2010.[4]
Early life
Bearing the title The Honourable from birth as a younger son of an Earl, Waldegrave was the youngest (by six years) of the seven children of Mary Hermione Grenfell and the 12th Earl Waldegrave, his elder brother being the present Earl. His father's title was created five generations earlier for the diplomat and ambassador James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave, whose grandfather was James II and VII.
Waldegrave is the nephew of the courtier Dame Frances Campbell-Preston and one of his sisters is Lady Susan Hussey, who became Baroness Hussey of North Bradley upon her husband's elevation to the House of Lords.
Education
Waldegrave was educated at Eton College, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1965, and at the University of Oxford where he was an undergraduate student of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. During his study, he served for a term as president of the Oxford Union and the Oxford University Conservative Association.[5] Oxford was followed by Harvard University in the United States, on a Kennedy Scholarship. In 1971, he was elected a Prize Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and is now[when?] a distinguished fellow.
Early career
In 1971, Waldegrave was working at the Conservative Research Department; that March he was appointed to the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS, also referred to as the 'Think-Tank'). "He was from the beginning one of the most active 'philosophers' of the CPRS, and the proponent of strong views about its proper roles and functions".[6] He was one of the few openly political members of the staff and was used by Victor Rothschild, head of the CPRS, as a link with both the Conservative party (then in government) and the outside, non-Civil Service world.[7] He left in December 1973.[8]
Parliamentary career
He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bristol West in 1979. He was regarded as a member of the "wet" or moderate tendency of the Conservative Party, and despite this progressed well from the backbenches in Margaret Thatcher's government.
As junior minister
He became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Education and Science in 1981 before moving to the Department of the Environment in 1983. He remained at Environment, becoming a Minister of State in 1985, until he became a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1988. In this post he was involved in setting policy on arms exports to Iraq; the initial draft of the Scott Report found that he had agreed in February 1989 to relax the policy, but had sent out 38 untrue letters to Members of Parliament stating that the policy was unchanged. However, Sir Richard Scott exonerated Waldegrave of "duplicitous intent" in wrongly describing the Government's policy.[9]
As a Cabinet minister
He was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Health in November 1990, just days before Thatcher's resignation, and remained a member of the Cabinet throughout John Major's time as Prime Minister. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the Cabinet Office with responsibility for public services and science in 1992, Secretary of State of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1994 and Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1995.
As member of the House of Lords
After losing his Commons seat to Valerie Davey in the 1997 general election, he entered the House of Lords being created a life peer as Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, of Chewton Mendip in the County of Somerset, on 28 July 1999.[10]
Private sector
Lord Waldegrave was a Director of Adam & Company, a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, from 2017 to 2018. He has been a Director of Coutts & Company, also a member of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, since 2012. He is currently non-executive director of GW Pharmaceuticals, which is involved in the cannabis business.[11][12]
Personal life
He is married to Caroline Burrows, cookery writer and managing director of Leith's School of Food and Wine. They have four children, Katherine, Elizabeth, James and Harriet.[citation needed]
Waldegrave is a trustee of Cumberland Lodge, an educational charity.[13] He is an active member of the Board of Managers for the Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University.[14]
Other notable events
Waldegrave attended Bilderberg Group meetings four times: 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1995.[citation needed]
In 1993, when he was the British science minister Waldegrave offered a prize for the best lay explanation of the Higgs Boson. He had observed that British taxpayers were paying a lot of money (in contributions to CERN) for something very few of them understood, and he challenged UK particle physicists to explain, in a simple manner on one piece of paper, 'What is the Higgs Boson, and why do we want to find it?'[15]
Professor David Miller's metaphor, which he entitled "A quasi-political explanation of the Higgs boson", is probably the most quoted explanation of the Higgs Boson and won the prize:[15][16]
Miller asked his listeners to imagine a room full of Conservative party workers quietly talking to one another. This represents the Higgs field in space.
A former Conservative Prime Minister enters the room. All the workers she passes are strongly attracted to her. As she moves through the room, the cluster of admirers around her create resistance to her movement, and she becomes 'heavier'. This can be imagined as how a particle moves through the Higgs field. The field clusters around a particle, resisting its motion and giving it mass.
If a sleazy rumour crosses the room, it creates the same sort of clustering. The workers gather together to hear the details, the cluster can move across the room as the workers pass on the details to their neighbours. This cluster is the Higgs particle or Higgs Boson.[citation needed]

Juaquin James Malphurs[1] (born May 31, 1986), known professionally as Waka Flocka Flame, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. He first became known for his 2009 single "O Let's Do It," which entered the Billboard Hot 100 and led him to sign with Gucci Mane's 1017 Records, an imprint of Warner Records that same year. His 2010 follow-up single, "No Hands" (featuring Roscoe Dash and Wale) reached number 13 on the chart and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Both songs, along with "Hard in da Paint" and "Grove St. Party" (featuring Kebo Gotti), preceded the release of his debut studio album Flockaveli (2010), which peaked at number six on the Billboard 200. His second studio album, Triple F Life: Friends, Fans & Family (2012) peaked at number ten on the chart was supported by the singles "Round of Applause" (featuring Drake), "I Don't Really Care" (featuring Trey Songz) and "Get Low" (featuring Tyga, Nicki Minaj and Flo Rida).
Malphurs was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City. His family ultimately settled in Riverdale, Georgia.[2] His mother, Debra Antney, is rapper Gucci Mane's former manager and the CEO of So Icey/Mizay Entertainment.[3] The name "Waka" was given to him by his cousin, after the Muppets character Fozzie Bear's catchphrase, "Wocka Wocka". The name "Flocka Flame" was given to him by Gucci Mane,[4] whom he has known since he was 19.[5]
In January 2009, Malphurs released his debut mixtape, Salute Me or Shoot Me.[6][7] The mixtape contained the song "O Let's Do It," which was released as a commercial single in April of that year. After which, the song was re-recorded and the guest performer was changed. The song was produced by L-Don Beatz.

Gucci Mane fired Malphurs' mother, Debra as his manager. There was initially no animosity between the two rappers due to this event. In an MTV interview, Malphurs affirmed that their relationship was, at the time, in good standing despite not being on speaking terms.[20] In early September, Gucci Mane attended at Malphurs' Flockaveli listening party in support of the artist.[21]
In 2011, Malphurs posed for a nude but not explicit promotional photo for PETA, to boycott killing animals and wearing fur. The picture reads "ink not mink".[22] Malphurs released several mixtapes in 2011, including Salute Me or Shoot Me 3, Benjamin Flocka and his last Twin Towers 2 (No Fly Zone) with fellow rapper Slim Dunkin.[23][24][25] On August 9, 2011, his collaborative album with Gucci Mane, Ferrari Boyz was released.[26] The first single was "She Be Puttin On", featuring the late Slim Dunkin, who was fatally shot the following year.[27]

Although he was seven years too young to be considered president,[50] the campaign, directed by Sam Lipman-Stern of Live from the Streets,[51] went viral and was picked up by media outlets such as CNN, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post, among others.[52][53]
On January 3, 2011, Waka Flocka turned himself in to authorities in Atlanta following a previous raid on his home.

On March 15, 2013, Gucci Mane announced that frequent collaborator and close friend Waka Flocka Flame was "dropped" from 1017 Brick Squad Records. The two rappers proceeded to throw insults back and forth on Twitter.[58] Though it was reported that Gucci's Twitter account was hacked, Waka stated, "Dont let da media fool u. This shit real Shawty."[59] On March 27, 2013, during an MTV Jams interview with Sway Calloway, Waka explained that he would never do music nor business with Gucci ever again. Neither of the rappers have explained where the controversy originated from. Waka has stated, "I guess we both be at the finish line we just going our own routes. That's all I can say. What's the reason? Sometimes it's none of your fuckin' business what's the reason. Just understand two men went they own ways but it's no problem."[60] In October 2013, Waka Flocka released a diss track towards Gucci Mane titled "Ice Cream".[61]
On November 19, 2013, it was revealed Gucci Mane had filed a lawsuit against Waka Flocka Flame, Waka's mother Debra Antney, OJ Da Juiceman, rapper Khia Stone and producer Zaytoven. The lawsuit accuses the parties of fraud, racketeering, and breach of contract. According to Gucci Mane, Waka's mother Antney took control of his 1017 Brick Squad Records, LLC., without permission, and used it to create three separate offshoot labels. Gucci also accused the parties in the lawsuit of withholding royalties and inflating the cost of label expenditures.[62] In his lawsuit, Gucci Mane also says that Antney took more than the typical 20 percent management fee. Gucci Mane also alleges that Antney's actions led to his having money and tax problems.[63]
Waka Flocka Flame would post a tweet on September 20, 2014, to his verified Twitter account that included an old picture of himself and Gucci Mane with the caption "… #NoBeef ", confirming that the two had buried the hatchet.[64]
In a February 2017 BBC Radio interview, Waka Flocka addressed his relationship with Gucci Mane, questioning his former mentor's street credibility and nixing the possibility of a Brick Squad reunion.[65] Several days later, Waka released "Was My Dawg", a diss track aimed at Gucci Mane, with cover art featuring the other rapper's silhouette.[66][67]
Malphurs is of African American, Native American, European (including Italian) and Dominican descent.[68]

After that situation I detoxed for like seven days. I changed my diet. I became 85% vegan. I just felt like I had to cleans

Sara Paxton is an American actress and singer. She began acting at an early age, appearing in minor roles in both films and television shows before rising to fame in Early October 2002. She played Sarah Tobin from Greetings from Tucson (2002-2003), the title role in the television series Darcy's Wild Life (2004-2006) and Sarah Borden in Summerland (2004). Her other films include Aquamarine (2006), Return to Halloweentown (2006), Sydney White (2007), Superhero Movie (2008), The Last House on the Left (2009), The Innkeepers (2011), and The Front Runner (2018).
Early life
Paxton was born in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles; she is the only child of Lucia (née Menchaca) and Steve Paxton.[1] Her mother, Lucia, was born to a Jewish family in Monterrey, Mexico and grew up in the city of Ciudad Acuña.[2][1][3][4][5] Paxton's father is of English and Scottish descent, and he converted to Judaism upon marrying her mother.[6][7] Both of her parents are dentists.[8] Sara Paxton did not have a bat mitzvah because of her filming schedule.[7]
Paxton was raised in the San Fernando Valley.[7] She graduated from El Camino Real High School in June 2006.[9]
In a 2009 interview with Teen Hollywood, Paxton disclosed that she had been accepted to several colleges, but decided not to attend any schools in favor of pursuing her acting career.[10][11][12][7]
Career
1997–2004: Early roles
Paxton has said that singing and acting performances "went hand in hand" during her early years, though she initially began working as an actress[7] appearing in musical theater and later in television commercials at a young age. Her first film role was a small role in the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar.[7] During the late 1990s and early 2000s, she appeared in a number of television and film roles, including voice roles in 15 episodes of the Nickelodeon animated series SpongeBob SquarePants, a role on the soap opera Passions, regular roles on the series Greetings from Tucson and Action; and a guest starring role on Disney Channel's Lizzie McGuire playing Holly, an ex-president of Lizzie's school.
In 2003, Paxton starred in R. L. Stine's Haunted Lighthouse, a short 3D film attraction that still plays at several theme parks across the United States. In the same year, she appeared as Lana Walker on the CSI: Miami season two episode "Death Grip." Paxton's first major role was in the teen film Sleepover, which opened in July 2004 to negative reviews and low box-office revenue.[13][14] During the same summer season, she appeared in several episodes of Summerland, playing Sarah Borden, a mentally troubled teen who experimented with drugs and sex with Jesse McCartney's character.
Paxton was the cast in the lead role of the Discovery Kids television series, Darcy's Wild Life playing Darcy Fields, a girl who works at a rural veterinary; the series was filmed on a farm in Toronto[7] and aired from 2004-2006. It often featured Paxton's song, "Take a Walk". She received an Emmy nomination for the role in 2006.
2005–2012: Mainstream recognition
In 2005, Paxton spent three months[7] working on the Florida-themed Aquamarine, in which she played the title character as a mermaid, opposite Emma Roberts and JoJo, whom she befriended while filming.[1] Paxton has said that she felt a sense of "female empowerment" while on set because "almost everyone" on set was female.[7] The film opened on March 3, 2006 and grossed approximately $7.5 million in its opening weekend.[15] Reviewers of the film compared Paxton, whose inspiration is Goldie Hawn, to actress Reese Witherspoon, saying that she has an "infectious, nutty energy."[1] Paxton recorded a song for the film's soundtrack titled "Connected," an English version of the Mexican group RBD's song Tenerte y Quererte from their 2004 album Rebelde. Paxton was signed to a record deal with Epic Records during the time she was cast in Aquamarine.[7] Her debut music CD, The Ups and Downs, featuring the titled single "Here We Go Again," was due for release by Epic at some point "in the future"; as of March 2007, Paxton has not completed work on it, and it was presumably shelved.[7][16]
Paxton hosted The Secret Life of Water, the first episode of the series Planet H2O, which premiered in April 2006 on public television stations. The following month, shortly after turning 18, she made an appearance on the television series Pepper Dennis, playing a teen actress. Paxton then appeared in Return to Halloweentown, replacing Kimberly J. Brown in the fourth installment in Disney Channel's Halloweentown series; she dyed her hair brown for the role. The film aired on October 20, 2006.
During the summer and early fall of 2006, Paxton filmed The Party Never Stops: Diary of a Binge Drinker, a Lifetime Television film, on Vancouver Island.[7] In the film, she plays Jessie, a college student who falls victim to binge drinking. Paxton described it as "very different" from her previous roles and has specified that she was looking for a role that would be a "challenge".[10] The film aired in March 2007.[17]
Paxton's next film role was in Sydney White, a college-set comedy starring Amanda Bynes and Matt Long; filming began on February 12, 2007 in Orlando, Florida and the movie was released on September 21, 2007.[18] She next starred in Superhero Movie, a parody on superhero films which began filming in September 2007 and was released on March 28, 2008. She provided backing vocals on her co-star Drake Bell's theme song for the movie Superhero! Song.[19]
Paxton starred in the remake of The Last House on the Left, playing the lead female character, Mari. The film was released on March 13, 2009.
2013–present: Television roles and film
Paxton starred in the CW drama series The Beautiful Life alongside Corbin Bleu, Mischa Barton and Elle Macpherson. The show premiered on September 16, 2009, but was cancelled after just two episodes.[20] It aired later online on YouTube. Paxton next co-starred with Scott Eastwood in the thriller Enter Nowhere;[4] she also played one of the lead roles in the Ti West film The Innkeepers.[21]
She starred in the 2011 movie Shark Night. She then played Mirabella on the ABC Family movie Lovestruck: The Musical in 2013.[22] In April 2016, it was announced that Paxton had joined the cast of David Lynch's 2017 Twin Peaks revival.[23]
In 2018, she co-starred as Donna Rice opposite Hugh Jackman in Jason Reitman's The Front Runner, a biographical film about politician Gary Hart.[24] In 2018-2019, she played Amber Dooley in the NBC series Good Girls.[citation needed]
Paxton has a supporting role in Andrew Dominik’s Blonde (2022), based on the biographical fiction novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates. The film is a fictionalized portrayal of the life and career of actress Marilyn Monroe.[25]
Personal life
In 2013, Paxton met Zach Cregger in Austin, Texas; they married in October 2019.[26]

Sir Oliver Letwin PC FRSA (born 19 May 1956)[1] is a British politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for West Dorset from 1997 to 2019. Letwin was elected as a member of the Conservative Party, but sat as an independent after having the whip removed in September 2019. He was Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer under Michael Howard and Shadow Home Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 2014 to 2016.
Following the 2015 general election Letwin was given overall responsibility for the Cabinet Office and became a full member of the Cabinet in the Conservative government. Previously he had been the Minister of State for Government Policy from 2010.[2]
During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold "indicative votes", allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons; it transpired that none of them could.[3] Letwin sought to extend Article 50 through passing the Cooper–Letwin Act. In August 2019 he announced that he would stand down at the next election.[4] On 3 September 2019, he lost the Conservative party whip and sat as an independent MP after that.
Early life and education
Letwin, who was born 19 May 1956 in London, is the son of William Letwin (14 December 1922 – 20 February 2013), emeritus professor at the London School of Economics, and the conservative academic Shirley Robin Letwin.[5][6] His parents were "Jewish-American intellectuals from Chicago whose parents had fled persecution in Kiev."[7]
He was educated at The Hall School, Hampstead and at Eton College. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a double first in history.[8][9] From 1980 to 1981, Letwin was a visiting fellow (a Procter Fellow) of Princeton University, then a research fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge, from 1981 until 1982.[10] His thesis, Emotion and Emotions, earned a PhD awarded by the Cambridge Philosophy Faculty in 1982.[11] He is also a graduate of the London Business School.[12]
Political career
He was a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Policy Unit from 1983 to 1986.
According to official government documents from 1985, released in December 2014 under the thirty-year rule, Letwin recommended that the Prime Minister "use Scotland as a trail-blazer for the pure residence charge", i.e. the controversial Community Charge or "Poll tax", having trialled it there first, and to implement it nationwide should "the exemplifications prove ... it is feasible."[13]
Another 1985 internal memo released in December 2015 showed Letwin's response to the Broadwater Farm riot, which blamed the violence on the "bad moral attitudes" of the predominantly Afro-Caribbean rioters, claiming that "lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale". It also criticised some of the schemes proposed to address inner-city problems, suggesting David Young's proposed scheme to support black entrepreneurs would flounder because the money would be spent on the "disco and drug trade". Letwin later apologised, saying that parts of the memo had been "both badly worded and wrong."[14][15][16]
Letwin co-authored Britain's biggest enterprise: ideas for radical reform of the NHS, a 1988 Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet written with John Redwood which advocated a closer relationship between the National Health Service and the private sector. This is regarded as providing a theoretical justification for NHS reforms carried out by subsequent governments, particularly the Health and Social Care Act 2012.[17]
Letwin stood unsuccessfully against Diane Abbott in Hackney North and Stoke Newington at the 1987 election, and against Glenda Jackson for the Hampstead and Highgate seat at the 1992 election.[18][19]
MP for West Dorset (1997–2019)
Letwin won the historically safe Conservative seat of West Dorset at the 1997 general election, achieving a majority of 1,840 votes over the next candidate.[20]
Shadow Cabinet (2000–2010)

As Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague appointed Letwin as a member of his Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in September 2000. He supported Michael Portillo and Michael Howard in their consecutive tenures as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.
He had previously been an official Opposition spokesman on Constitutional Affairs, Scotland and Wales from 1998, and was promoted to Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1999.
During the campaign for the 2001 general election, Letwin expressed an aspiration to curtail future public spending by £20 billion per annum relative to the plans of the Labour government. When this proposal came under attack as regressive, Letwin found few of his colleagues to defend it, and he adopted a low profile for the remainder of the campaign. He went into hiding during the 2001 election.[21] At this election, his majority in his West Dorset constituency was cut to 1,414 votes.
In September 2001, he was appointed Shadow Home Secretary by the new Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith. In this role, he attracted plaudits for his advocacy of a "neighbourly society", which manifested itself in calls for street by street neighbourhood policing, modelled on the philosophy of the police in New York. He was also largely credited with forcing the then Home Secretary to withdraw his proposal in 2001 to introduce an offence of incitement to religious hatred. He successfully argued that such an offence would be impossible to define, so there would be little chance of prosecution. He also argued that Muslims would feel persecuted by such a law. In late 2003, Michael Howard appointed Letwin as his successor as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Shadow Chancellor he focused on reducing waste in the public sector.
At the 2005 general election the Conservative Party claimed to have found £35 billion worth of potential savings, to be used for increased resources for front-line services and for tax cuts. This approach was credited with forcing the government to introduce bureaucracy reduction and cost-cutting proposals of their own. In May 2005, Letwin's majority in his seat increased to 2,461 votes, despite his hard pro-EU views.[22] After the election, Letwin was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Times reported that he had requested a role less onerous than his former Treasury brief so that he would have time to pursue his career in the City.[23] Until December 2009, he was a non-executive director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild Corporate Finance Ltd.[24]
Following Michael Howard's decision to stand down as Conservative Party leader after the 2005 election, Letwin publicly backed the youngest candidate and eventual winner David Cameron.
In the lead-up to the 2010 general election, Letwin played an important role in the development of Conservative policy, and was described by Daniel Finkelstein as "the Gandalf of the process".[25] The 2010 general election saw him increase his majority to 3,923 votes.[26]
Cameron premiership (2010–2016)
British Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Letwin to the newly-created office of Minister of State for Government Policy in the newly-formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition government in May 2010. His responsibilities included developing government policies with the Cabinet Office, as set out in the Coalition's programme for government, as well as implementing departmental business plans. He also attended the Cabinet, although not as a full member or Cabinet Minister.
Letwin was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 14 July 2014, succeeding Lord Hill of Oareford who became the United Kingdom's next European Commissioner.[27] He also continued in his role as Minister for Policy until the 2015 general election, when the position was abolished.
He was returned with a much increased majority of 16,130 votes by his West Dorset constituents at the 2015 general election. Following that election, Letwin remained Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cameron also appointed him as a full member of the new Conservative government's Cabinet with responsibility for overall charge and oversight of the Cabinet Office.
Immediately after the 23 June 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Cameron appointed Letwin "Minister for Brexit". He appeared on 5 July before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and was criticised for Government's lack of planning for a leave vote. Cabinet was accused of "dereliction of duty". When committee chairman Crispin Blunt observed upon the resignation of Cameron that Letwin had been left "holding the baby", Letwin said,[28]
"I can only say that the baby is being firmly held, and that my intention is that the baby should prosper – because I care about the baby in question. It is, in fact, our country."
Letwin was awarded a knighthood by David Cameron in the 2016 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours List. This gave him the honorific title "Sir" for life.
May premiership (2016–2019)
The new Prime Minister Theresa May terminated Letwin's tenure as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and split the Minister for Brexit position he had held, creating the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and handing that job to arch-Leaver David Davis.[29]
In 2018, Letwin led an "independent review" into the delivery of housing on large development sites.[30]
During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold "in

James Vernon Taylor (born March 12, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.[5] Taylor is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 100 million records worldwide.[6]
Taylor achieved his breakthrough in 1970 with the No. 3 single "Fire and Rain" and had his first No. 1 hit in 1971 with his recording of "You've Got a Friend", written by Carole King in the same year. His 1976 Greatest Hits album was certified Diamond and has sold 12 million copies in the US alone. Following his 1977 album JT, he has retained a large audience over the decades. Every album that he released from 1977 to 2007 sold over 1 million copies. He enjoyed a resurgence in chart performance during the late 1990s and 2000s, when he recorded some of his most-awarded work (including Hourglass, October Road, and Covers). He achieved his first number-one album in the US in 2015 with his recording Before This World.[7]
Taylor is also known for his covers, such as "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)" and "Handy Man", as well as originals such as "Sweet Baby James".[7] He played the leading role in Monte Hellman's 1971 film Two-Lane Blacktop.
Early years
James Vernon Taylor was born at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on March 12, 1948. His father, Isaac M. Taylor, worked as a resident physician at the hospital[8][9] and came from a wealthy Southern family.[8] Taylor is of English and Scottish descent from the Taylor family of the Montrose area,[10] with the former being rooted in Massachusetts Bay Colony; his ancestors include Edmund Rice, an English colonist who co-founded Sudbury, Massachusetts.[11] His mother, Gertrude (née Woodard; 1921–2015), studied singing with Marie Sundelius at the New England Conservatory of Music and was an aspiring opera singer before she married Isaac in 1946.[8][12] Taylor is the younger brother of musician Alex Taylor (1947–1993) and the older brother of musicians Kate Taylor (born 1949) and Livingston Taylor (born 1950).[13] His youngest sibling, a brother named Hugh (born 1952), was also a musician; Hugh eventually left the music industry and has operated The Outermost Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Aquinnah, Massachusetts, with his wife since 1989.[13][14]
In 1951, Taylor and his family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina,[15] when Isaac took a job as an assistant professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.[16] They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated.[17] James later said, "Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, caused by local copper mining [Taylor's later song, "Copperline" was a nostalgic salute to that area where Taylor grew up], plus the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people."[17] James attended a public primary school in Chapel Hill.[8] Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1955 and 1956.[18] Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971.[19] Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on Martha's Vineyard.[20]
Taylor took cello lessons as a child in North Carolina, before learning the guitar in 1960.[21] His guitar style evolved, influenced by hymns, carols, and the music of Woody Guthrie, and his technique derived from his bass clef-oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand."[22]  Spending summer holidays with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York.[23] The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar felt that Taylor's singing had a "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that thing."[24] Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at 14, and he continued to learn the instrument effortlessly.[22] By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as "Jamie & Kootch".[25]
In 1961, Taylor went to Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Massachusetts. He faltered during his junior year, feeling uneasy in the high-pressure college prep environment despite having a good scholastic performance.[26] The Milton headmaster later said, "James was more sensitive and less goal-oriented than most students of his day."[27] He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at Chapel Hill High School.[26] There he joined a band formed by his brother Alex called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964, they cut a single in Raleigh that featured James's song "Cha Cha Blues" on the B-side.[26] Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year,[26] where he started applying to colleges to complete his education.[28] But he felt part of a "life that [he was] unable to lead", and he became depressed; he slept 20 hours each day, and his grades collapsed.[26][29] In late 1965 he committed himself to McLean, a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts,[26] where he was treated with chlorpromazine, and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure.[27][29] As the Vietnam War escalated, Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative.[30] Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated Arlington School.[30] He later viewed his nine-month stay at McLean as "a lifesaver... like a pardon or like a reprieve",[29] and both his brother Livingston and his sister Kate later were patients and students there as well.[27] As for his mental health struggles, Taylor thought of them as innate and said: "It's an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings."[28]
Career
1966–1969: Early career
At Kortchmar's urging, Taylor checked himself out of McLean and moved to New York City to form a band.[30] They recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band King Bees to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of academic Jerome Wiesner) to play bass. After Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine.[27][31] They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as "Knocking 'Round the Zoo", "Don't Talk Now", and "The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream".[29][31] In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt.[32] By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village, alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People.[33]
Taylor associated with a motley group of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar's dismay.[27][33] In a late 1966 hasty recording session, the group cut a single, Taylor's "Night Owl", backed with his "Brighten Your Night with My Day".[34] Released on Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, it received some radio airplay in the Northeast,[34] but only charted at No. 102 nationally.[35] Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album.[34] After a series of poorly chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport, Bahamas for which they were never paid, the Flying Machine broke up.[34] (A UK band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song "Smile a Little Smile for Me". The New York band's recordings were later released in 1971 as James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine.)
Taylor would later say of this New York period, "I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs."[32] Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown heroin addiction during the final Flying Machine period: "I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink."[34] He hung out in Washington Square Park, playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment.[36] Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions.[36] Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly.[37]
Taylor decided to try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea.[38] After recording some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A&R head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records.[39] Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including "Something in the Way She Moves", to Asher,[40] who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great ... and he came and played live, so it was just like, 'Wow, he's great.'"[39] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple,[39] and he credits Asher for "opening the door" to his singing career.[

Lee Soo-jin ​(m. 1992)​Korean nameHangul차승원Hanja車勝元Revised RomanizationCha Seung-wonMcCune–ReischauerCh'a Sŭngwŏn
Cha Seung-won (Korean: 차승원; born June 7, 1970) is a South Korean actor, who began his career as an in-demand fashion model in the 1990s. Cha achieved stardom through the hit comedy films Kick the Moon (2001), Jail Breakers (2002), My Teacher, Mr. Kim (2003), and Ghost House (2004). After proving his versatility in other genres, notably in the period thriller Blood Rain (2005) and the melodrama My Son (2007), Cha's popularity continued with the television series Bodyguard (2003), City Hall (2009), The Greatest Love (2011), A Korean Odyssey (2017), One Ordinary Day (2021) and Our Blues (2022).
Career
Cha dropped out of Sungkyunkwan University,[1] and began a successful career as a fashion model in 1988.[2] He was cast in the TV sitcom New York Story, which would eventually pave the way for his debut in film.[3]
Although his debut film Holiday In Seoul (1997) and many of his subsequent roles did not establish him as a major star, he attracted attention in 2000 for his performance as an arsonist in the firefighting film Libera Me. The following summer, the runaway success of Kim Sang-jin's comedy Kick the Moon (over 4.3 million tickets sold) secured his place in the industry as a leading actor with strong star appeal.[3] Since then, Cha has become one of the few surefire box office draws in the country. In a 2005 survey of influential movie producers, he was ranked among the top ten most bankable stars.[4]
In early 2003, Cha took on a slightly more serious role as a corrupt schoolteacher who is transferred to a country school in the film My Teacher, Mr. Kim. The film grossed over 2.4 million admissions and drew Cha additional praise for his acting abilities (he would later team up again with director Jang Gyu-seong for 2007 comedy Small Town Rivals[5]). His next role, in Ghost House, reunited him with director Kim Sang-jin in a successful comedy about a man who buys a dream home, only to discover it is haunted by a young female ghost.[3]
In 2005 Cha put aside the comic roles he had become known for and appeared in the grisly period thriller Blood Rain.[6][7] The film's unexpectedly robust commercial success confirmed Cha's popularity among Korean audiences.[3] He further proved his versatility in Jang Jin's Murder, Take One (also known as The Big Scene).[8][9][10]
Cha starred in his first melodrama Over the Border (2006), about a North Korean defector.[11][12][13] He then reunited with Jang Jin in My Son (2007), and he said his experience as a father helped a lot in learning the character.[14] Stylish crime thrillers Eye for an Eye (2008),[15] and Secret (2009) followed.[16][17][18][19]
Cha returned to television in 2009, in the political fairytale City Hall penned by writer Kim Eun-sook.[20][21][22] 2010 was a busy year for him,[23][24] with Cha appearing in two films, the Lee Joon-ik-helmed period actioner Blades of Blood,[25] and Korean War film 71: Into the Fire,[26][27][28] followed by spy series Athena: Goddess of War.[29][30][31][32]
In 2011 his character in the hit romantic comedy series The Greatest Love, arrogant top star "Dokko Jin," became a mini pop culture phenomenon, giving rise to numerous commercial deals and parodies, as well as awards for Cha.[33][34][35]
Cha made his theater debut in 2012 in the stage play Bring Me My Chariot Fire alongside Japanese actors Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Ryōko Hirosue, Teruyuki Kagawa, and Korean veteran actor Kim Eung-soo. Set in the historically turbulent early 1900s, the plot focuses on the friendship of artists from Korea and Japan who work together to preserve traditional Korean arts.[36][37][38]
In 2014, Cha signed with the talent agency YG Entertainment,[39][40] then starred in the police series You're All Surrounded.[41] This was followed by his third team-up with director Jang Jin in the comedy noir film Man on High Heels, which subverted Cha's "macho" image by having him play a transgender homicide detective.[42][43]
In 2015, Cha appeared in Three Meals a Day: Gochang Village, a cable reality show set on the remote Manjae Island for which he earned the nickname "Chajumma" (from the word ajumma) because of his versatile cooking skills despite the minimal amount of ingredients and implements.[44][45] He was then cast as Prince Gwanghae in the period drama Splendid Politics, which focused on power struggles for the throne amid the backdrop of the Joseon Dynasty.[46][47] Cha next plays cartographer and geologist Kim Jeong-ho in Kang Woo-suk's period epic Gosanja, Daedongyeojido, adapted from Park Bum-shin's novel The Map Maker.[48]
In 2017, Cha was cast in tvN's fantasy romantic comedy drama A Korean Odyssey by the Hong sisters.[49] Cha the starred in the family comedy-drama film Cheer Up, Mr. Lee in 2019[50] and the disaster film Sinkhole in 2021.[51]
Later in 2021, he starred alongside Kim Soo-hyun in the Coupang Play's television series One Ordinary Day, based on the British television series Criminal Justice.[52] In 2022, he appeared in the tvN drama Our Blues.[53]
Personal life
Cha and his wife Lee Soo-jin are biological parents to daughter Cha Ye-ni (born 2003, christened as Rachel). In July 2014, a man claiming to be the birth father of Cha and Lee's son Cha No-ah (born 1989, christened as Noah)[54] filed (and quickly dropped) a ₩100 million defamation lawsuit against Cha, which led to the actor admitting that No-ah is Lee's son from her previous marriage, and that when he and Lee got married, Cha legally adopted No-ah, who was then three years old. Cha had previously falsified his marriage date as 1989 to match No-ah's age, apologizing for the white lie since their son did not know his paternity.[55][56]

Datuk Siti Rahmah Kassim (30 November 1926 – 24 March 2017) was an independence fighter, best known for donating her golden bangle to Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's 1st Prime Minister, to pay for his flight to London to meet with Secretary of State for the Colonies Oliver Lyttelton and negotiate the independence of Malaya (which subsequently became Malaysia in 1963) from the United Kingdom.
The Golden Bangle
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
In 1957 Tunku Abdul Rahman had called for an emergency UMNO meeting at Dewan Hang Tuah in Bandar Hilir, Malacca, where he lamented that the party did not have sufficient funds to send him and his delegates to Britain for independence negotiations, and asked for donations from the public. He had reportedly shed tears while saying so, which inspired Siti Rahmah to take off her golden bangle and donate it. She supposedly said, "This was a gift from my father for my wedding, but use it to aid in your fight for the country." She then walked around the hall asking the crowd to contribute to the fight for independence. "Those who are inside and outside this hall, please make donations to help Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj to go to London for the sake of the people and nation," she said. Inspired by her selflessness, men purportedly took off their rings, gold wristwatches and even the gold handles off their walking sticks, while women pledged earrings, brooches and dress pins.
She had said that her action was spurred by her love for the country, people and religion in an interview with Bernama in 2010.
Politics
Siti Rahmah began her political career at the young age of 18 when she actively protested against the Malayan Union, and she became the first woman to contest in the 1959 general election. She held the Tementang seat in Rembau for two consecutive terms on the Alliance ticket until 1969. Even in her late 80s, Siti Rahmah was active in UMNO. In an interview with The Star, she had said, "Don't join UMNO today and hop to another party tomorrow just because someone says that party is better," referring to party hopping, while also praising then Prime Minister Najib Razak.[1]
Death
Siti died at 10:55 am on March 24, 2017 in Kelana Jaya, Petaling Jaya. Her body was brought to the Al-Hidayah Mosque for funeral prayers and buried at the Bukit Kiara Muslim cemetery.[2]

<s> Andreas KisserKisser in 2018Background informationBirth nameAndreas Rudolf KisserBorn (1968-08-24) 24 August 1968 (age 55)São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, BrazilGenres
Andreas Rudolf Kisser (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈɐ̃dɾeɐz ʁuˈdowf ˈkiseʁ]; born 24 August 1968) is a Brazilian musician, best known for being the lead guitarist for the metal band Sepultura. He has been featured on every Sepultura release since their second album, Schizophrenia. Additionally, Kisser has also been involved in other bands such as the rock supergroup Hail!, Sexoturica and, more recently, De La Tierra.
Biography
Kisser was born in São Bernardo do Campo, a municipality in São Paulo to a Slovene mother, from Maribor, Slovenia, and a German father. His father was a mechanical engineer and his mother was a teacher and amateur artist. At an early age, Kisser showed an interest in music.
He was 10 when he started to listen to his parents' records of the Beatles, Roberto Carlos and Tonico & Tinoco.[1] He received his first acoustic guitar from his grandmother and later won a second guitar at a game of Bingo.[2] In his early adolescence, Kisser started to play acoustic guitar first learning basic chords from the Brazilian popular music repertoire and later on classical pieces. A friend then introduced Kisser to hard rock with bands like Queen and Kiss which had a great influence on him. In 1983, he went to see Kiss live in São Paulo and his father took him to Rock In Rio in 1985 to see AC/DC.[3] Kisser eventually got his first electric guitar, a Giannini-Supersonic, and an overdrive pedal. Kisser's first guitar was purchased for him by his mother.[4] Some of his major influences consisted then of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Howe, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimmy Page and Randy Rhoads.[5]
Career
Kisser started performing in 1984 in a three-piece band called Esfinge, which he formed with school friends and where he played guitar and sang. The band played essentially covers of heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Venom and Metallica. Two years later the band renamed itself Pestilence and, in 1987, recorded a demo called Slaves of Pain. The songs on the demo were afterwards reused by Sepultura in their albums Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains. Pestilence was, however, short-lived and ultimately split up.[6]
Sepultura
In 1987, Kisser met the members of Sepultura and went to see the band play live while he was on a vacation trip to Belo Horizonte. On the day of the concert he joined the band as an improvised roadie for vocalist/guitarist Max Cavalera. He also jammed with the members during the intermissions. Following the departure of original lead guitarist Jairo Guedes, Kisser auditioned for the position of lead guitarist.[7] The same year he performed with the band for the first time in Caruaru, Pernambuco and recorded the album Schizophrenia.[8] His involvement in Sepultura helped shape the band's evolving sound.[9] Max Cavalera said of him:
"... he brought new ideas and influences into Sepultura. The result was Schizophrenia."
On Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains, Kisser co-wrote the lyrics with Max, whereas the whole band wrote the music. For Arise and thereafter Kisser began to write songs of his own. Kisser has also occasionally provided backing vocals both live and on the records. He also fronted the band in 1996, at the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock festival, when Max Cavalera was forced to absent himself in order to attend the funeral of his stepson Dana Wells.
Hail!
Kisser is also a member of the metal tribute band Hail!. That band's rotating cast of members include Tim "Ripper" Owens, Paul Bostaph, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso, Phil Demmel and Roy Mayorga. Hail! Was formed in the late 2008 by Ellefson and music manager Mark Abbattista.[10][11] The band's original lineup, which consisted of DeGrasso, Ellefson, Kisser and Owens, started a series of concerts in 2009 in Chile. The band then toured Europe and played an exclusive concert in Lebanon. In 2010, Hail! went on a second European tour and played a number of US shows with the following line-up: Andreas Kisser, Tim "Ripper" Owens, Paul Bostaph and James LoMenzo.[12][13][14]
De La Tierra
In December 2012, Kisser formed the Latin American supergroup De La Tierra with Alex González of Maná, Andrés Giménez of A.N.I.M.A.L. and Sr. Flavio of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The band first released a teaser and a number of behind-the-scene footages of the recording before releasing their debut single "Maldita Historia" in 2013.[15][16][17]
Film composition
Kisser worked on three Brazilian movie soundtracks. For No Coração dos Deuses ("In the Heart of Gods"), a 1999 drama film, he worked on the score with Igor Cavalera and Mike Patton. The soundtrack was recorded at the Estudio ION in São Paulo in June 1998 and produced by André Moraes.[18] In 2001 Kisser worked alongside Tony Bellotto, Eduardo de Queirós, Charles Gavin on the score of the award-winning crime film Bellini and the Sphinx.[19] Kisser collaborated again on the soundtrack for the 2008 sequel Bellini and the Devil.[20]
Solo work
In August 2009, Kisser released his solo debut album entitled Hubris I & II.[21] When not active with Sepultura Kisser experimented musical ideas, wrote and recorded demo material, some of which had been gestating for 15 years prior to the album's release. In 2007, he uploaded a few short videos of the recording process through his YouTube account. It finally took Kisser 6 years to complete the album during which he handled a great part of the production duties himself.[22][23] In the months following the release Kisser played a few shows in Brazil to promote the album and took part in a music video shoot for the song "Em Busca Do Ouro". The album was eventually nominated at the 2010 Latin Grammys in the "Best Brazilian Rock Album" category.[24]
Guest work and collaborations
Kisser worked on various musical projects. Between 1995 and 1996 Kisser recorded a number of demo tracks with Jason Newsted and Tom Hunting under different monikers. For the first project the trio recorded three demo tracks under the name Sexoturica which later became part of the compilation album IR8 vs. Sexoturica.[25] For the second project, called Quarteto da Pinga and which included Robb Flynn, they recorded two tracks and a cover.[26] In 1996 Kisser renewed his collaboration with Newsted on another project called Godswallop which included Carl Coletti on drums and Sofia Ramos on vocals.[27]
Furthermore, Kisser has made multiple guest appearances on other bands' albums, providing additional (lead) guitar and/or vocal accompaniment. He has been featured on the album of bands such as Asesino, Astafix, Biohazard, Burning in Hell, Claustrofobia, Korzus, Krusader, Nailbomb, Ratos de Porão and The AK Corral. In 2005, Kisser took part in the recording of the Roadrunner United album. He played guitar on the tracks "The Enemy", "Baptized in the Redemption", and "No Mas Control". He also played at the 25th Anniversary Concert.[28][29][30] In 2008 Kisser worked on a Brazilian Beatles tribute album Álbum Branco, which was recorded at the Bavini Studio in São Paulo. He played guitar on the tracks Piggies and Helter Skelter.[31][32]
Beside his work as musician, Kisser has been involved in projects as producer. In 1992 Kisser co-produced Hammerhead's album Shadow of a Time to Be.[33] In 2004 he recorded three songs for the Brazilian rock band Sayowa which appeared on the band's debut album Treme Terra. The same year he helped produce Necromancia's album Check Mate and provided additional guitar and backing vocal on the album's title track "Greed Up to Kill".[34] In 2006 he produced Sayowa's second Album. The album was also co-produced by the band itself and Stanley Soares.[35]
Trivia
In 1992, Kisser unsuccessfully auditioned for the temporary position of rhythm guitarist of Metallica, as a temporary replacement of James Hetfield, who had suffered severe burns on his left hand and arm during a live show in Montreal. Kisser had been recommended to Metallica through Phil Rind of Sacred Reich who was well acquainted with Jason Newsted.[36][37]
In 2008, he took part in the Scorpions Humanity World Tour in Mexico and Brazil as a guest musician, recording the "Amazônia - Live in the Jungle" DVD.[38][39]
In 2011, Kisser replaced Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian for some European tour dates (2–16 July), including the Big 4 Sonisphere Festival shows in Gothenburg, Sweden as well as Knebworth, UK and Amneville, France, as Ian and his wife Pearl Aday were expecting the birth of their first child.[40][41]
Kisser played a few concerts with Brazilian Beatles cover band Clube Big Beatles in The Cavern Club in Liverpool and, in August 2012, was given his own brick in the Cavern Club's wall of fame. He thus became the first Brazilian to have one, and the first modern metal guitarist to be honoured in that way.[42][43]
Equipment
Guitars
Kisser currently uses Fender, Jackson and Seizi guitars. He has been endorsing Fender guitars since 2002 and Seizi guitars since 2011.[44][45] Seizi guitars is currently in the process of releasing a signature model.

Idriss Ngari (born 2 April 1946[1][2]) is a Gabonese politician and army general. A relative of President Omar Bongo, Ngari rose rapidly through the ranks of the army, ultimately serving as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces from 1984 to 1994. He then held a succession of posts in the government of Gabon, serving as Minister of Defense from 1994 to 1999, Minister of Transport from 1999 to 2002, Minister of the Interior from 2002 to 2004, Minister of Public Works from 2004 to 2007, Minister of Tourism from 2007 to 2009, and finally as Minister of Health in 2009. Considered one of Gabon's most powerful figures during Omar Bongo's rule, Ngari is a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG).
Military career
An ethnic Téké,[1] Ngari was born in Ngouoni, located in the Haut-Ogooué Province of eastern Gabon, in 1946.[1][2][3] Omar Bongo, who was also a native of Haut-Ogooué, was a maternal uncle of Ngari.[1][4] Ngari joined the army in 1968 and trained to become an officer, studying in Côte d'Ivoire at the officers' school in Bouaké, as well as at Montpellier in France. Back in Gabon, he rose quickly to very high rank: he was  aide-de-camp to the Military Cabinet of President Omar Bongo from 1977[1][3] to 1978, Chief of Staff of Ground and Naval Forces from 1978 to 1983, and then Chief of Staff of the Armies from 1983 to 1984.[1]
Ngari was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces in 1984 and remained in that post for ten years.[1] As Chief of Staff, he ordered commandos from the Presidential Guard to destroy Radio Liberté, an opposition radio station, on 22 February 1994; the destruction of the station led to several weeks of unrest.[5] According to Ngari, the station was inciting violence and hatred and it had to be shut down for the good of the country.[6]
Soon after the destruction of Radio Liberté, President Bongo appointed Ngari to the government as Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration in March 1994.[1][7] Given its sensitive status, Bongo was always careful to maintain reliable control over the Defense Ministry; for years he had personally managed the defense portfolio, and beginning in 1981 he entrusted it to family members. Ngari's appointment marked a continuation of that practice.[8]
Political career
As Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration, Ngari oversaw a January 1995 operation in which about 50,000 illegal immigrants were expelled from Gabon, while about 15,000 were granted legal status and allowed to remain.[1]
A powerful figure in the PDG regime,[3] possessing extensive influence within the military and his own Téké ethnic group,[1][4] Ngari was close to President Bongo and was considered a rival to Bongo's son, Ali Bongo.[9] He and Ali Bongo competed for political dominance in the Haut-Ogooué Province at the time of the December 1996 parliamentary election.[1][9][10] Ngari supported candidates who ran against Ali Bongo's allies in seeking the PDG nominations for parliamentary seats in the province, but his candidates were not successful.[1][10] Ngari, however, was elected to a seat in the National Assembly.[7]
After the 1996 election, Ngari remained Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration, and he was assigned additional responsibility for posts and telecommunications on 28 January 1997.[11] However, he was moved to the position of Minister of Transport and the Merchant Marine[7][12] on 25 January 1999,[12] and his rival, Ali Bongo, was appointed to replace him at the Defense Ministry.[9]  President Bongo was reportedly displeased by Ngari's electoral competition with his son in 1996.[10] Rumors suggested that Ngari was deeply frustrated by the 1999 reshuffle, in which he was effectively demoted, for long afterward.[3][13]
Identified as the leader of "aggressive loyalists" within the PDG regime, Ngari and his supporters resisted the inclusion of more members of the opposition in the government; President Bongo typically endeavored to co-opt opposition parties by offering ministerial portfolios to their leaders.[14] He was again elected to the National Assembly in the December 2001 parliamentary election,[7] and on 27 January 2002 he was moved to the position of Minister of the Interior, Public Security, and Decentralization.[7][12]
Ngari spent two and a half years as Interior Minister before being appointed as Minister of Public Works, Equipment, and Construction on 5 September 2004;[4][12][15] he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State, while retaining the same portfolio, on 21 January 2006.[12] In the December 2006 parliamentary election, he was again elected to the National Assembly as a PDG candidate in Haut-Ogooué Province.[16] He was later moved to the post of Minister of Tourism and National Parks on 29 December 2007 and was simultaneously reduced to the rank of ordinary minister.[12] Later, in the government named on 14 January 2009, he was instead appointed as Minister of Public Health and Public Hygiene.[17]
Although Ngari, who was associated with the PDG's cacique wing, was disliked by the PDG's reformist (renovateurs) wing, which was headed by Ali Bongo, he was nevertheless considered a potential successor to Omar Bongo.[3] After Omar Bongo died on 8 June 2009, Ngari was considered perhaps the most formidable potential challenger to Ali Bongo in the contest for the PDG's presidential nomination,[13] but he chose not to seek the nomination[18] and it was won by Bongo. It was reported that Ngari briefly considered allying himself with Pierre Mamboundou, an old opponent of Omar Bongo and the PDG,[19] but he nevertheless supported Bongo's campaign.[20]
Amidst the events of mid-2009, Ngari remained in his post as Minister of Public Health. While visiting hospitals on 5 August 2009, he announced that the first known case of the H1N1 flu in Gabon had been found. He said that the patient, a French national, had been quarantined, and he called for vigilance to prevent any outbreak of the disease.[21]
Bongo officially prevailed in the 30 August 2009 presidential election, defeating Mamboundou and an array of other challengers;[20] upon taking office, he immediately dismissed Ngari from the government on 17 October 2009.[20][22] Ngari's dismissal was part of a major reworking of the state administration, in which many prominent ministers and officials were replaced.[20] Having lost his post in the government, Ngari then took up his seat in the National Assembly, representing Ngouoni.[23]
In the December 2011 parliamentary election, Ndari was re-elected to the National Assembly. He was then elected as Second Vice-President of the National Assembly on 27 February 2012.[24]
Personal life and other activities
Like Omar and Ali Bongo, Ngari is a Muslim, belonging to a faith that is practiced by only a very small percentage of the native Gabonese population. He is a member of the Higher Council of Islamic Affairs of Gabon, a body that works to coordinate Islamic activities.[1]

Gerhard Julius Richard Fischer later Gerhard Julius Richard Fisher, Gerhard R. Fisher (March 18, 1899 – May 2, 1988) was a U.S. entrepreneur of German descent. He contributed to the development and popularity of the hand held metal detector.
Biography
Fisher was born in 1899 in Landeshut, Silesia, to Richard Hugo Georg Arthur Fischer, an engineer, and his wife Margaretha Julia Fischer née Job. His mother was from Łódź, where the parents also married. Around 1906, the Fischer family moved to Dresden. After studying electrical engineering at the Dresden University, Fischer emigrated to the U.S. In 1931, he founded Fisher Research Laboratory, Inc. in Palo Alto, where he served as president until his retirement in 1967. While working  with aircraft radio detection finders environment-dependent changes became apparent. From the interference by metal, he concluded that the device must also be suitable for detecting metal. Fisher shared the idea with Albert Einstein who correctly predicted the proliferation of hand held metal detector use. In 1937, he patented his metal detector. He died 1988 in Palo Alto.
Inventions
Although the actual inventor of the hand-held metal detector is disputed, the hand-held metal detector was made in 1925 and was first patented by Dr. Gerhard Fisher in 1931. A metal detector had been invented some forty years earlier (1881) by Alexander Graham Bell for the sole purpose of locating a lead bullet in President James A. Garfield.
Fisher Research Laboratory
He founded Fisher Research Laboratory to develop and market the hand held metal detectors in 1931.

<s> Adil Rami (born 27 December 1985) is a French former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.
Rami began his football career playing for amateur club Étoile Fréjus Saint-Raphaël, then known as ES Fréjus. Due to only playing the sport as a hobby, he spent three seasons at the club playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. In 2006, Rami ascended three divisions after signing with Ligue 1 club Lille. At Lille, Rami developed into a starter, making his professional debut in May 2007. He is nicknamed "Shrek" by teammates and Lille supporters. In January 2011, Rami joined Spanish club Valencia on a four-year contract. However, he was immediately loaned back to his previous club and was a part of the Lille team which won the league and cup double.
Despite constant early inquiries from Morocco prior to his first selection, Rami chose to play for his home country of France. He was in the preliminary list to play for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals but did not make the final squad. Rami made his senior debut on 11 August 2010 in a friendly match against Norway.
Early life
Rami was born in the city of Bastia on the island of Corsica to Moroccan parents. He holds French and Moroccan nationalities.[4] As a youth, his family moved to the mainland, eventually settling in the southern coast city of Fréjus, where his mother worked as a member of the city council. Rami is the third of four children and has two sisters and one brother.[5] While training to become a professional football player, Rami worked for the city after his family grew concerned for his future. He often did odd-jobs such as taking care of the maintenance and cleanliness of the city.[5]
Club career
Early career
Rami registered as a youth player for Étoile Fréjus Saint-Raphaël, then known as ES Fréjus, in 1994 at the age of nine. Despite harbouring ambitions of playing football professionally, Rami only played the sport as a hobby and worked for city hall to support himself.[6] He made his amateur debut for the club during the 2003–04 season while Fréjus were playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. He appeared in four matches in his first season.[7] In the 2004–05 season, Rami appeared in 24 matches as Fréjus finished mid-table.[8]
Ahead of the 2005–06 season, Rami switched to playing in central defence. He initially played as an offensive player often in the midfield, but following an injury to a teammate, whom Rami described as his best friend, his coaches inserted him into defence.[9] The transition was a success, with Rami appearing in 30 matches with Fréjus finishing mid-table for the third consecutive season.[10] Midway through the campaign, Rami was offered a trial by professional club Lille. Eager to leave the amateur club, he took the opportunity and after a week's training session with Lille, which Rami described as "hard", he was signed to an amateur contract with Fréjus receiving €10,000.[9]
Lille
Upon his arrival to the club, Rami was inserted onto the club's Championnat de France amateur team and was supervised by coach Pascal Planque, who Rami stated gave him the best opportunity to grow as a player.[9] Rami appeared in 27 matches as the team finished in third position, the highest finish amongst professional clubs' reserve team's playing in the group.[11] With two months remaining in the 2006–07 Ligue 1 season, Rami was called up to the senior team by manager Claude Puel. He made his professional debut on 19 May 2007 in a Ligue 1 match against Auxerre, starting at centre-back. The following week, Rami started again, against Rennes. On 4 June, Rami signed his first professional contract after agreeing to a three-year deal lasting until 2010.[12] He was then promoted to the senior squad on a permanent basis and assigned the number 23 shirt.
In the 2007–08 season, Rami was declared a starter by Puel and inserted at centre-back, alongside captain Grégory Tafforeau. In the opening match of the season, against Lorient, Rami featured in the match until the 69th minute, when he suffered an injury to ligaments in one of his knees.[13] He subsequently missed three-and-a-half months due to the injury, returning in November 2007. Upon his return, Rami featured in every remaining match for Lille, save for one league match. Lille finished the campaign in seventh position, one spot out of Europe. After the season, Rami signed a two-year contract extension with the club.[14]
For the 2008–09 season, Rami's Ligue 1 season debut against Nancy was halted in injury time after earning a straight red card.[15] On 18 October 2008, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–2 draw against Lyon.[16] The following month, Rami scored against Marseille in another 2–2 draw.[17] On 1 February 2009, he scored the would-be game-winner against Bordeaux in the 57th minute. However, the goal was canceled out eight minutes later by Yoann Gourcuff to draw the match at 2–2.[18] Rami's fourth and final goal of the season was the team's second goal in a 3–2 win over Nancy on the final day of the league season.[19] The victory secured fifth place for Lille, which resulted in the club qualifying for the newly created UEFA Europa League.
Following the season, Rami drew considerable interest from several clubs, which included French clubs Marseille and Lyon, English clubs Liverpool and Arsenal and Italian club Milan. Despite suitable offers for the player, Lille chairman Michel Seydoux declared that Rami was not going to be leaving the club after a reported move to Marseille for €12 million was abruptly canceled in July 2009.[20] The announcement led to a distraught and angry Rami declaring he would see out the rest of his contract with Lille playing in the reserves if he was not transferred. He even went as far as to state that there was a conspiracy between Lille and Lyon, due to the club's easy negotiations during transfers between each other, as well as Seydoux's brother, Jérôme, being a shareholder of Lyon.[21] On 15 August 2009, Rami apologized for the comments and said he would remain at Lille.[22]
Rami began the 2009–10 season again as a starter as Lille struggled early on due to its tough schedule, in which the team faced Marseille, Paris Saint-Germain and Toulouse in the first four weeks of the season. He made his UEFA Europa League debut on 30 July 2009 in the first leg of the club's third qualifying round match.[23] Rami scored his first goal of the season on 19 September in the annual Derby du Nord match against Lens. With Lille trailing 1–0 in injury time at a hostile Stade Félix-Bollaert, Rami connected on a header following a corner kick in the 93rd minute to draw the match at 1–1, which was the final result.[24] On 28 October, he scored his second goal against Saint-Étienne in a 4–0 victory after delivering a curling free-kick from almost 35 metres out.[25][26] On 25 February 2010, Rami scored the aggregate-winning goal in the team's round of 32-second leg tie away to Fenerbahçe after connecting on a header five minutes from time.[27]
Valencia
On 3 January 2011, Spanish club Valencia confirmed on its website it had reached an agreement with Lille for the transfer of Rami, with the La Liga outfit paying Lille a reported transfer fee believed to be in the range of €6–10 million.[28][29] Rami finished the 2010–11 campaign with Lille on loan from Valencia and officially joined his parent club on 13 June after successfully passing a medical.[30]
Rami made his debut for Valencia against Racing de Santander in a 4–3 home win. In the same match, he scored his first goal for the club from a corner kick, making it 2–3.[31]
AC Milan
On 25 September 2013, Valencia temporarily suspended Rami from his contract after he gave an interview on Radio Valencia in which he openly criticised his teammates and his coach, Miroslav Đukić.[32][33] He was also fined €275,000 (€130,000 net) of his remaining salary owed for the half of the season, the largest ever imposed by Valencia.[34] Meanwhile, Rami left the Spanish club and started training with AC Milan. On 16 October 2013, Valencia gave him permission to train with the Italian club and an agreement was reached between the clubs that the player would be loaned to Milan when the winter transfer window opened, on 3 January 2014, with an option to purchase.[35][36]
On 6 January 2014, Rami made his debut in Serie A, coming on as a substitute for Cristián Zapata in a match against Atalanta, a 3–0 win. On 1 February, he scored his first goal in Serie A, against Torino. On 23 February, he scored his second goal against Sampdoria. His third and last goal of the Serie A season came on 16 March, against Parma.[citation needed]
On 12 July 2014, Milan signed Rami on a three-year contract with a £3.37 million (€4.25 million) fee to Valencia.[37] Rami personally paid €500,000 to cover the payment difference with Valencia, as Milan refused to pay the original buy-out clause of €7.5 million, only offering €3.75 million.[38][39] He scored his first goal in the 2014–15 season on 28 September 2014 with a glancing header in a 1–1 draw with Cesena.[40]
Sevilla
On 1 July 2015, Spanish newspaper Marca confirmed that Sevilla had reached an agreement with Milan to sign Rami for four seasons, with the transfer fee believed to be €3.5 million.[41]
Marseille
On 13 July 2017, Rami joined Ligue 1 club Olympique de Marseille on a four-year contract for a €6 million transfer fee.[42] On 27 July, he made his competitive debut for Marseille, in their 2017–18 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round, first leg match against Oostende at the Stade Vélodrome, playing the full 90 minutes of the 4–2 victory. He made his Ligue 1 debut for Marseille on 6 August in their home match against Dijon, again playing the full 90 minutes of the match, which Marseille won 3–0. On 14 September, he headed home Dimitri Payet's corner to score his first competitive goal for Marseille in their 2017–18 UEFA Europa League group stage 1–0 home win over Konyaspor.[43] On 3 May 2018, he played every minute of the Europa League semi-final second leg match away to FC Red Bull Salzburg which Marseille lost 2–1 after extra-time but won 3–2 on aggregate to secure a place in the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final[44] which was played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, Lyon, France on 16 May 2018,[45] against Atlético Madrid. Rami played the full 90 minutes of the final, which Atlético Madrid won 3–0.
On 11 November 2018, Rami scored his first Ligue 1 goal of the 2018-19 season and also assisted the opening goal that was scored by Lucas Ocampos in the 2–0 home win over Dijon.[46] On 19 December, Rami missed the las

Career
Milwaukee Brewers
Díaz signed with the Milwaukee Brewers as an international free agent in 2011. He pitched in the Dominican Summer League as a 17- and 18-year old, and then spent the 2014 and 2015 seasons in the rookie-level Arizona League.  In 2016, he worked in the Class-A Midwest League, starting 15 games and making 11 more appearances out of the bullpen with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.
San Diego Padres
Díaz was selected by the Minnesota Twins with the first pick of the 2016 Rule 5 draft and was then traded to the San Diego Padres.[1][2] Díaz made the Padres' 2017 Opening Day roster[3] and made his Major League debut on Opening Day.  Díaz was initially used as a reliever, but transitioned into a starter role in June.  While making his third start, Díaz suffered a forearm strain and ended up on the disabled list.[4]  He returned to the Padres in September, again pitching in relief.[5]  For the 2017 season, he totaled 33 strikeouts in 412⁄3 innings and a 7.34 ERA.
In 2018, the Padres intended to develop Díaz as a starter,[6] and he was optioned early in the spring to minor league camp.[7]  Díaz began the season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, where the Padres tried to stretch out his arm, and then was promoted to Triple-A El Paso in mid-May.[8]  He was moved back to San Antonio in June after struggling with El Paso.[9]
The Padres called up Díaz for a single game at the beginning of July to help rest an over-extended bullpen.  Díaz struck out four batters in one of the two scoreless innings he pitched, becoming only the second Padre to accomplish the feat.[10]  Díaz returned to the Major League club in mid-August and stayed with the team for the remainder of the season, working out of the bullpen.[11]  He finished with a 4.82 ERA, 30 strike-outs, and 12 walks in 182⁄3 innings at the big league level.

Early life
Palmer was born and raised in Adelaide, South Australia, the only child of Kevin Palmer, an investor, and Paula Sanders, a former nurse and missionary.
Her parents separated when she was three, and divorced in 1992 when she was six.[3] She has a stepmother, Kaaren Palmer, as well as two half-sisters and three stepbrothers, who lived with her father.[4][5] Palmer stated to Interview that she "came from rather humble beginnings";[6] she lived in public housing with her mother, while regularly visiting her father at his farm near Mylor in the Adelaide Hills (which she later purchased as an adult).[3][7][8] Palmer was named after Mother Teresa by her mother, and has stated that she had a "tough upbringing" due to her mother's manic depression.[9][10]
Palmer was a student at Mercedes College, a private Catholic day school,[11] and won a local-casting audition, "Search for a Movie Star", in 2003.[12] Her first acting job was dressing up as a Strawberry Shortcake doll and as an elf assistant to mall Santa Clauses on weekends for promotions in shopping centres near Adelaide.[13][14] Palmer went to acting classes for a couple of years and appeared in several television commercials.[10] She was a fast-food attendant at Hungry Jack's in Rundle Mall in 2005, before working at clothing retailers Supré, Mambo Australia and Cotton On.[15][16][17]
After graduating from high school, Palmer thought that she would work in an animal rescue service, and eventually open her own animal welfare agency.[18] She was accepted into a university to study teaching and was taking a course on journalism, but had always dreamt of acting.[3][19] She got a call from an agent about appearing in a student film, 2:37.[6] The director had seen her head shot on the acting agency's website and wanted her to be in the movie. Palmer dropped out of the university to work on the film.[10]
Career
2005: Beginnings in Australia
Palmer had been an extra on Deck Dogz (2005), and other films shot in Adelaide.[4][20] At the age of 18, she was cast by filmmaker Murali K. Thalluri in the independent Australian film 2:37,[21] about a tragic highschool suicide.[6] She was nominated for the 2006 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Lead Actress for her performance.[22] She then signed with a talent agent in Sydney.[4] A role in Wolf Creek (2005) followed, in a pool party scene.
Palmer starred in the psychological thriller Restraint, with English actor Stephen Moyer and Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel. Shot on location around New South Wales in mid-2005, the film was written by Dave Warner and directed by David Denneen.[23] Palmer was named an Australian "star of tomorrow" by Screen International that year.[24] She then starred in December Boys, a coming-of-age film set in the 1960s, based on a novel by Michael Noonan. She played Lucy, who has a romance with Daniel Radcliffe's character in a remote beach town. Palmer studied Dominique Swain's performance in Lolita (1997) to capture her character's overt sexuality.[25] The film began shooting in November 2005 on the south coast of Australia.[26] It was released on 14 September 2007 in the UK and US and 20 September 2007 in Australia[27] and received mixed reviews,[28] and failed at the box office.[29]
2:37 premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival in Un Certain Regard selection. The film received a standing ovation, a turning point for Palmer, giving her confidence in acting as a career. The trip to Cannes led her to meet her manager, David Seltzer, and American talent agents.[4][30] She signed with the William Morris Agency.[31]
2006–2012: Move to Hollywood
Palmer was cast to star with Tom Sturridge in her first American feature, Jumper, a science fiction film directed by Doug Liman.

Gerardo Fernández FeBorn (1971-01-15) January 15, 1971 (age 53)Havana, CubaOccupationNovelistLanguageSpanishGenreLiterary fiction
Gerardo Fernandez Fe (Havana, January 15, 1971) is a Cuban novelist and essayist. His best-known works are the novels La Falacia (1999) and El último día del estornino (2011)  and the books of essays Cuerpo a diario (2007) and Notas al total (2015).[1]
In 2018, his essay Moleskine Sergio Pitol was published in Mexico. José Kozer: tajante y definitivo, an extensive interview with the laureate Cuban poet, was published in 2020.
History
Fernandez Fe graduated of French Language at University of Havana in 1995. He has worked as translator and professor of French in Cuba and in Ecuador. He has translated into Spanish the works of Roland Barthes, Gilles Deleuze, Antonin Artaud, Emil Cioran and Denis Roche, among others authors.
In 1990, with 19 years, he won the poetry prize Luis Rogelio Nogueras in Havana with his first book El llanto del escriba, published two years afterwards. It was followed by Relicarios (1994) and Las palabras pedestres (1996). The latter won the David prize of poetry of the previous year.
Fernandez Fe wrote his first novella, La Falacia, in 1996.  “A work of deep anxiety and odd maturity… (…)", according to the Cuban writer and Leonardo Padura."It is an indisputable sign that a new narrator has born in Cuba (…).”.[2] The novella received an honorable mention in the Contest Italo Calvino, of which Padura was one of the jurors.
The book of essay Cuerpo a diario (2007) is a curious panorama on diaries written in extreme situations like war, illness or living in totalitarian states.
In the 2011 he published El último día del estornino. For the critic Jeff Lawrence, this book marks "the insertion of Fernández Fe in an important current of contemporary Latin American writers like Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bolaño, and Juan Villoro".[3]
Rafael Rojas thinks that in this novel there is "a multiple invention of writing, text, authorship and reader, trying to destabilize the poetic traditions of the Cuban literature of the last half century"[4]
Of his book Notas al total, published in 2015, the Cuban critic Gilberto Padilla Cárdenas has said: "Notas al total was probably the best book published by a Cuban writer in the year 2015. GFF Is in the Hall of the Fame of the Cuban essay (...) While the others age, GFF rejuvenates with a literature (...) that reads like a battle of other genres -journalism, history, testimony, etc.- against the nirvana of the traditional forms."[5]
In the prologue of Hotel Singapur (2021), Cuban novelist Abilio Estévez says that the novel "highlights what La Falacia and El último día del estornino seemed to make quite clear: Gerardo Fernández Fe is already one of the essential Cuban writers born after 1959".
Fernández Fe has published on Letras Libres, Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos, Hypermedia Magazine, Diario de Cuba, and El Nuevo Herald, among others.

Augusto Martínez Sánchez (1923 – 2 February 2013) was a Cuban lawyer and politician, and one of the commanders of the Cuban Revolution close to Fidel Castro. Martínez Sánchez was a member of the July 26 Movement since April 1958 and participated in the guerrilla struggle in the Sierra Maestra against the government of Fulgencio Batista, attached to the Second Eastern Front "Frank País", under the direct orders of Raúl Castro.
Military Prosecutor
In 1959 he was appointed Military Prosecutor directing the purges against the military and police forces that had served Batista. From this position, he was responsible for the execution of those Batista elements who had committed crimes against humanity against the Cuban civilian population.
Minister of National Defense
Upon the triumph of the rebel forces, he was appointed Minister of National Defense of the first cabinet of the revolutionary government chaired by Manuel Urrutia, according to a decree of January 10, 1959, but always under the direct orders of Fidel Castro.
Martínez Sánchez was the first substitute as Prime Minister on Castro's trip to New York in April 1959. In December of that same year, Martínez Sánchez's car was the target of an attack by opponents of the revolutionary government, in which three of his escorts were injured.

(Sanchez: middle)
On March 29, 1962, he was appointed Judge of the Revolutionary Court that tried the participants in the Invasion of the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961. Commanders Juan Almeida Bosque, Guillermo García, Sergio del Valle, and Manuel Piñeiro were also members of this Court. He worked also with Piñeiro in the Ministry of the Interior.
Minister of Labor
At the beginning of the sixties, he was appointed Minister of Labor. In 1964 he was removed from this position by Fidel Castro personally due to strong accusations of corruption.[1]
Suicide attempt
On December 8, 1964, apparently as a result of errors in his work, Augusto Martínez Sánchez shot himself in the head[2] but failed in his suicide attempt and survived. He never returned to public life. He went into retirement with the rank of colonel in the late 1980s.
Between October and December 2010, he traveled with permission to Miami, United States of America, where his eldest son Augusto Martínez resided since the early eighties; later the Cuban ex-military man returned to the island.
His last wish was to be cremated and his ashes deposited in the Veterans Pantheon of the Colón Cemetery, Havana, Cuba.

Glover Lucas Teixeira[5] (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈɡloveʁ tejˈʃejɾɐ]; born 28 October 1979) is a Brazilian-American retired professional mixed martial artist. He competed in the Light Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion. Teixeira is a former member of the Brazilian National Wrestling Team and has competed in the WEC, Impact FC, PFC and Shooto. He is the second oldest UFC champion in history behind Randy Couture and the oldest first time champion in UFC history.
Background
Teixeira is originally from the rural community of Sobrália, Minas Gerais, Brazil and is of Portuguese descent. There was no electricity in many of the homes in his community, and there was only one gas station. He moved to Danbury, Connecticut in 1999 to help support his family and found a job in landscaping. It was there that he met his wife, Ingrid.
After watching boxers such as Mike Tyson and the early mixed martial arts fighters such as UFC Hall of Famer Royce Gracie and Chuck Liddell compete, Teixeira decided that he wanted to follow the same path. He had never heard of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, but was able to find and watch videos of UFC 1 and UFC 2, which featured Royce Gracie.
After working 10 to 12-hour days landscaping, Teixeira did boxing training at Hat City Boxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu at American Top Team Connecticut. John Hackleman, who had trained a fighter who fought Teixeira and was impressed by the young Brazilian, invited Teixeira to his gym in California, The Pit, where Teixeira began training with Chuck Liddell.[6] Teixeira now trains and instructs at his own gym Teixeira MMA & Fitness in Bethel, Connecticut.[7]
In November 2020, Teixeira became an American citizen. "I'm so proud today because I’m officially an American Citizen. Now I’m very proud to represent both Brazil & America," said Teixeira.[8]

George Dewey Cukor (/ˈkjuːkɔːr/ KEW-kor;[1] July 7, 1899 – January 24, 1983) was an American film director and producer.[2] He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations. His career flourished at RKO when David O. Selznick, the studio's Head of Production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including What Price Hollywood? (1932), A Bill of Divorcement (1932), Our Betters (1933), and Little Women (1933). When Selznick moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, Cukor followed and directed Dinner at Eight (1933) and David Copperfield (1935) for Selznick,  and Romeo and Juliet (1936) and Camille (1936) for Irving Thalberg.
He was replaced as one of the directors of Gone with the Wind (1939), but he went on to direct The Philadelphia Story (1940), Gaslight (1944), Adam's Rib (1949), Born Yesterday (1950), A Star Is Born (1954), Bhowani Junction (1956), and won the Academy Award for Best Director for My Fair Lady (1964), which was his fifth time nominated. He continued to work into the early 1980s.
Early life
Cukor was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the younger child and only son of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants Viktor, an assistant district attorney, and Helén Ilona Gross. His parents selected his (first and) middle name in honor of Spanish–American War hero George Dewey. The family was not particularly religious (pork was a staple on the dinner table), and when he started attending temple as a boy, Cukor learned Hebrew phonetically, with no real understanding of the meaning of the words or what they represented. As a result, he was ambivalent about his faith and dismissive of old world traditions from childhood, and as an adult he embraced Anglophilia to remove himself even further from his roots.[3]
As a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with David O. Selznick, who in later years became a mentor and friend.[4] As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the New York Hippodrome by his uncle. Infatuated with theatre, he often cut classes at DeWitt Clinton High School to attend afternoon matinees.[5][6] During his senior year, he worked as a supernumerary with the Metropolitan Opera, earning 50¢ per appearance, and $1 if he was required to perform in blackface.[7]
Following his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in law. He halfheartedly enrolled in the City College of New York, where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918. His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor's duty ended after only two months. He left school shortly afterwards.[8]

Cukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of The Better 'Ole, a popular British musical based on Old Bill, a cartoon character created by Bruce Bairnsfather.[9] In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between Syracuse, New York and Rochester, New York, and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly formed Lyceum Players, an upstate summer stock company. In 1925, he formed the C.F. and Z. Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct.[10][11] Following their first season, he made his Broadway directorial debut with Antonia by Hungarian playwright Melchior Lengyel, then returned to Rochester, where C.F. and Z. evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included Louis Calhern, Ilka Chase, Phyllis Povah, Frank Morgan, Reginald Owen, Elizabeth Patterson and Douglass Montgomery, all of whom worked with Cukor in later years in Hollywood.[12] Lasting only one season with the company was Bette Davis. Cukor later recalled: "Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction. She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and ingenue roles, she didn't hesitate to express them." For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again.[13]
For the next few years, Cukor alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter. His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of The Great Gatsby by Owen Davis brought him to the attention of the New York critics. Writing in the Brooklyn Eagle, drama critic Arthur Pollock called it "an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be."[14] Cukor directed six more Broadway productions, then departed for Hollywood in 1929.
Early Hollywood career
When Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for sound films, Cukor immediately answered the call. In December 1928, Paramount Pictures signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his train fare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship. He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of River of Romance to speak with an acceptable Southern accent.[15] In October, the studio lent him to Universal Pictures to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for All Quiet on the Western Front, released in 1930. That year, he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1,500.[16] He made his solo directorial debut with Tarnished Lady (1931) starring Tallulah Bankhead.
Cukor was then assigned to One Hour with You (1932), an operetta with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, when original director Ernst Lubitsch opted to concentrate on producing the film instead. At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor's consent. Upon the film's completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager B.P. Schulberg and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor's name wasn't removed from the credits. When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit. He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with David O. Selznick at RKO Studios.[17]
Cukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a "woman's director", a title he resented. Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the Academy Award for Best Actor than any other director: James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story (1940), Ronald Colman in A Double Life (1947), and Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady (1964). One of Cukor's earlier ingenues was actress Katharine Hepburn, who debuted in A Bill of Divorcement (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her. Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as Little Women (1933) and Holiday (1938), and disastrous, such as Sylvia Scarlett (1935). Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set.
Cukor was hired to direct Gone with the Wind by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published.[18] He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous screen tests of actresses anxious to portray Scarlett O'Hara. Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as "box office poison", would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one. Of those who did, Cukor preferred Paulette Goddard, but her supposedly illicit relationship with Charlie Chaplin (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick.[19]
Between his Wind chores, the director assisted with other projects. He filmed the cave scene for The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938),[20] and, following the firing of its original director Richard Thorpe, Cukor spent a week on the set of The Wizard of Oz (1939). Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating Judy Garland's blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner.[21][22] Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow's makeup and gave Margaret Hamilton a different hairstyle for the Wicked Witch of the West, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from 20th Century Fox, as the Tin Man.
Cukor spent many hours coaching Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland before the start of filming Wind, but Clark Gable resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent. However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O. Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark Gable had anything to do with Cukor's dismissal from the film. Rather, they show Selznick's mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor's slow pace and quality of work. From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to Margaret Mitchell in February 1939: "George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing...the things did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble...So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back...he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture...and bull-headed David said 'OK get out!'"[23]
Selznick had already been unhappy with Cukor ("a very expensive luxury") for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with Victor Fleming. "I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it...We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts." Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and Olivia de Havilland off the set. Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood. Selznick's friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, includin

Chaim Zev Malinowitz (1952 – November 21, 2019) was a Haredi community rabbi, dayan (rabbinical court judge), and Talmudic scholar. Fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview), he was the general editor of the 73-volume Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll. After immigrating to Israel, he became the rabbi of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham, an English-speaking congregation for Anglophone Israeli immigrants in Ramat Beit Shemesh, which he led for 17 years.
Early life and education
Chaim Zev Malinowitz was born in 1952 on the Lower East Side of New York City.[2] His father, Rabbi Avrohom Aharon Malinowitz, had been a student of Aharon Kotler in Kletsk, Poland (historically Lithuania, now Belarus).[2] Malinowitz was a gifted student at Rabbi Jacob Joseph School. After his bar mitzvah, he was accepted to the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia where, albeit younger than the other students, he skipped two grades and was accepted to the beth midrash (undergraduate-level) program under Rabbi Mendel Kaplan.[2] His desire to have more time for study led him to begin awakening at 4 a.m. and praying vasikin, the pre-dawn prayer, a practice he maintained for the rest of his life.[2]
He next studied at Yeshivas Iyun HaTalmud in Monsey, New York, under Rabbi Abba Berman, a main disciple of Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz. He remained at this yeshivah for six years, until his marriage in 1976, whereupon he entered the kollel.[2] In 1980, he was appointed by Berman to take over as rosh kollel when Berman made aliyah to Israel.[2][3] In the early 1970s, Malinowitz also studied the Tanya in a late-night shiur given by Chabad rabbi Yoel Kahn.[4]
Rabbinic career
After receiving rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Malinowitz served as a dayan (rabbinical court judge) for the rabbinical court of Kollel HaRabbanim in Monsey. In this role, he became known as a "world authority on gittin" (Jewish divorce) and also dealt with cases of agunos.[2] He staunchly opposed the 1992 New York Get Law proposed by Jewish activist groups, which would penalize husbands who refused to grant their wives a get by making it difficult for them to arrange a civil divorce. Malinowitz contended that the coercive element of the penalty could halakhically invalidate all divorces in New York. Ultimately, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach's decision on the matter, which agreed with Malinowitz's position, eroded support for the law.[2]
In 1992 Malinowitz was appointed, along with Rabbi Yisrael Simcha Schorr, as general editor of the Schottenstein Edition of the Babylonian Talmud published by ArtScroll.[5] The English-language Schottenstein Talmud spanned 73 volumes and was completed over a period of 15 years.[6] Malinowitz was responsible for approving "every single line and every single footnote" of the translation and commentary of the Talmud submitted by the editorial staff for both the English and Hebrew editions.[5] According to a senior editor on the project, Rabbi Eliezer Herzka: "His role was to learn through the sugya [topic] with the ArtScroll commentary to probe it to find its weak points". Herzka explained that Malinowitz's knowledge of the Talmud was so broad that he would know when the present sugya inadequately covered important opinions by the classic Talmudic commentators that were cited in similar sugyas elsewhere in Talmud.[2] Nothing was considered final until Malinowitz approved the finished draft.[2][3] Malinowitz also worked on ArtScroll's elucidated Mishnah project.[5] He continued his association with ArtScroll after making aliyah in 1997.[2]
Upon moving to Israel, Malinowitz began to teach at Yeshivat Aish HaTorah.[2] In 2002, he was hired as Rav of Beis Tefillah Yonah Avraham in Ramat Beit Shemesh, an English-speaking congregation catering to Anglo olim.[7] As a community rav, Malinowitz introduced many shiurim to the synagogue schedule, including classes on different subjects and at different levels for men, women, and children. He also studied one-on-one with many congregants.[2][5]
Personal qualities
Malinowitz was fluent in all areas of the Talmud, halakha (Jewish law), and hashkafa (Orthodox Jewish worldview). He combined this knowledge with "fearlessness" to act on his convictions and a strong desire for truth.[2] At the same time, he was regarded as a friendly, "down to earth" personality who cared for others.[2][8]
Personal life
Malinowitz married Simi Maza, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Maza, a Torah educator, in 1976.[2] The couple had six sons and four daughters.[2] After making aliyah, they resided in Jerusalem.[2]
Malinowitz died in Jerusalem on November 21, 2019, at the age of 67.[7] He was buried in the Rechovot cemetery near his parents.[5]

Marie Alexandrine Becker (née Petitjean; 14 July 1879 – 11 June 1942), nicknamed The Black Widow, was a Belgian serial killer who was sentenced to death for poisoning eleven people between 1933 and 1936, and attempting to poison five others. Since capital punishment in Belgium had not been applied since 1863, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.[1][2][3]
Biography
Marie Petitjean was born in the rural village of Waasmont, Landen municipality. She rarely attended school, having to help her parents in the fields, but nevertheless asked the village priest to teach her writing, reading and arithmetic. At the age of sixteen, she left her family to live with an aunt who ran a rope shop on Saint-Pholien Street in Liège; she often used peket to retain the male clientele. At the age of 17, on 15 August 1896, she met her first lover, a man named Yann, at the Marian feasts in the Outremeuse district. This was the first of a very long series of marriages. In 1900, when she was 21 years old, she began work for a sewing shop. Marie was very passionate about her job and excelled at it. She was considered to be a pretty, lively and joyful woman who pleased the men.[1][2][3]
"She offered us something to drink and if we wanted to go further, she never said no. And for no money!"— Elisabeth Lange, The first serial killer, 3rd Edition, 2011
In 1905, at the Universal Exhibition in Liège, she met the man who would become her husband - Charles Becker Sr. At that time, she was climbing the social ladder, going from the status of a saleswoman to managing the fittings in a large fashion store on Pot d'Or Street in Liège. She now had her own home and frequented the wealthy bourgeoisie areas to give her fashion advice.[1][2][3]
She married Charles Becker Sr. in 1906, and the couple soon moved into the house adjoined to the family sawmill, where Mr. Becker and his two sons, Charles Jr. and Gustave, worked. Marie, however, did not get on well with the family, and frequently argued with Léontine, Gustave's wife. Angered, the father threatened Charles Jr. to dismiss his daughter-in-law who was a charcuterie in Bressoux. Unbeknownst to the family, the trade was rapidly collapsing. Marie then started to cheat on her husband more often, explaining in her trial that "it is not given to all women to resist the advances of men."[1][3]
In 1912, Charles Sr. died, which allowed Charles Jr. to resume his duties in the family business. Marie then opened a sewing workshop in one of the rooms of the house, bringing in a growing number of customers. She was heavily inspired by the models of Paul Poiret, even copying some of them.[1][3]
During the First World War, she courted for the Germans; the sawmill was badly hit but its trade continued to flourish. In 1920, she achieved her long-standing goal of opening a fashion business in Liège on Saint-Léonard Street. Success continued, and she then employed four workers. In 1928, she met a lover to whom Marie became extremely and passionately devoted, Maximilien Houdy, who was twenty years younger. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the dissoluting morals of Becker put an end to her business, whose bankruptcy was pronounced in 1934.[1][2][3]
In October 1932, Charles Becker Jr. died as a result of a cancer. Marie then used some of the acquired money to pay off debts and maintain Houdy. In 1933, she relaunched a seamstress day business for wealthy clients. A friend then suggested to her that she broaden her talents and begin to take care of court ladies. She thus began to frequent near rich ladies-in-waiting, from whom she borrowed money when she did not deprive them of their titles or jewels. It is this that led to her life of big spending.[1][2][3]
The Becker Affair
This article is missing information about the actual crimes. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (November 2022)
Marie was arrested on 16 October 1936 as she was preparing her 17th poison of digitalis for a woman named Mrs. Lamy. The subsequent investigation shed light on the murders. She was judged on 7 July 1938, and the following day found guilty of eleven murders, five attempted murders, theft and forgery. She was sentenced to death and, as has been the practice since 1863, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Marie Becker died in the Forest Prison during the Second World War on 11 June 1942.[1][2][3]

Harrison Ford (born July 13, 1942) is an American actor. Considered a leading man in films of several genres, he is regarded as an American cultural icon.[1] His films have grossed more than $5.4 billion in North America and more than $9.3 billion worldwide.[2][3][4] Ford is the recipient of various accolades, including the AFI Life Achievement Award, the Cecil B. DeMille Award, an Honorary César, and an Honorary Palme d'Or, in addition to an Academy Award nomination.[5][6]
Ford made his film debut in an uncredited appearance in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966) and went on to play supporting roles in such films as Journey to Shiloh (1968), Getting Straight (1970), American Graffiti (1973),  and The Conversation (1974). He gained worldwide fame for his starring role as Han Solo in the epic space opera film Star Wars (1977), a role he reprised in four sequels over the next four decades. The multimedia franchise became a global cultural phenomenon. Ford is also known for his portrayal of the titular character in the popular media franchise Indiana Jones, beginning with the action-adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). He played the character in four additional sequels over the next four decades and also starred as Rick Deckard in the cult science fiction film Blade Runner (1982) and its sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and portrayed Jack Ryan in the spy thriller films Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994).
Ford's on-screen career spans six decades in both film and television. His other films include Witness (1985), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, The Mosquito Coast (1986), Working Girl (1988), Presumed Innocent (1990), Regarding Henry (1991), The Fugitive (1993), Sabrina (1995), The Devil's Own (1997), Air Force One (1997), Six Days, Seven Nights (1998), Random Hearts (1999), What Lies Beneath (2000), K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), Firewall (2006), Morning Glory (2010), Cowboys & Aliens (2011) 42 (2013), The Age of Adaline (2015), and The Call of the Wild (2020). Ford has since starred in the Paramount+ western series 1923 (2022–present) and the Apple TV+ comedy series Shrinking (2023–present).
Outside of acting, Ford is a licensed pilot; he has often assisted the emergency services in rescue missions near his home in Wyoming, and he chaired an aviation education program for youth from 2004 to 2009.[7] Ford is also an environmental activist, having served as the inaugural vice chair of Conservation International since 1991.[8]
Harrison Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois,[9] on July 13, 1942,[10] to former radio actress Dorothy (née Nidelman) and advertising executive and former actor John William "Christopher" Ford.[11] His younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945.[12] Their father was a Catholic of Irish descent,[11] while their mother was an Ashkenazi Jew whose parents were emigrants from Minsk, Belarus, then in the Russian Empire.[11][13] When asked in which religion he and his brother were raised, Ford jokingly responded "Democrat"[14] and more seriously stated that they were raised to be "liberals of every stripe".[15] When asked about what influence his Jewish and Irish Catholic ancestry may have had on him, he quipped, "As a man I've always felt Irish, as an actor I've always felt Jewish."[16][17][18]
Ford was a Boy Scout, achieving the second-highest rank of Life Scout. He worked at Napowan Adventure Base Scout Camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director Steven Spielberg later decided to depict the young Indiana Jones as a Life Scout in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Ford graduated in 1960 from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois. His voice was the first student voice broadcast on his high school's new radio station, WMTH,[17] and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year. He attended Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin,[17] where he was a philosophy major and a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. A self-described "late bloomer",[19] Ford took a drama class in the final quarter of his senior year to get over his shyness and became fascinated with acting.[20][21][22] Ford was expelled from college four days before graduation.[23]
In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin,[24][25] Ford traveled to Los Angeles and eventually signed a contract with Columbia Pictures' new talent program.[11]: 60–69  His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking (or "extra") roles in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokofsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokofsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.[11][page needed]
His speaking roles continued next with Luv (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as "Harrison J. Ford" in the 1967 Western film A Time for Killing, starring Glenn Ford, George Hamilton and Inger Stevens, but the "J" did not stand for anything since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the "J" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Gunsmoke, Ironside, The Virginian, The F.B.I., Love, American Style and Kung Fu. He appeared in the western Journey to Shiloh (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point as an arrested student protester. In 1968, he also worked as a camera operator for one of the Doors' tours.[26] French filmmaker Jacques Demy chose Ford for the lead role of his first American film, Model Shop (1969), but the head of Columbia Pictures thought Ford had "no future" in the film business and told Demy to hire a more experienced actor. The part eventually went to Gary Lockwood. Ford later commented that the experience had been nevertheless a positive one because Demy was the first to show such faith in him.[27][28]
Not happy with the roles offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter[17] to support his then-wife and two young sons. Clients at this time included the writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, who lived on the beach at Malibu. Ford appears in the documentary Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold. He and his wife became friends of the writers.[29] Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in American Graffiti (1973).[17] Ford's relationship with Lucas profoundly affected his career later. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979); in the latter film, Ford played an army colonel named "G. Lucas".
Ford's work in American Graffiti eventually landed him his first starring film role, when Lucas hired him to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in Lucas's upcoming epic space-opera film Star Wars (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as Han Solo.[30] Star Wars became one of the most successful and groundbreaking films of all time, and brought Ford, and his co-stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, widespread recognition. Ford began to be cast in bigger roles in films throughout the late 1970s, including Heroes (1977), Force 10 from Navarone (1978) and Hanover Street (1979). He also co-starred alongside Gene Wilder in the buddy-comedy western The Frisco Kid (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. Ford returned to star in the successful Star Wars sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), as well as the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to kill off Han Solo at the end of Return of the Jedi, saying, "That would have given the whole film a bottom," but Lucas refused.[31]

Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), an action-adventure collaboration between Lucas and Steven Spielberg that gave Ford his second franchise role as the heroic, globe-trotting archaeologist Indiana Jones. Like Star Wars, the film was massively successful; it became the highest-grossing film of the year. Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, but Lucas was not, having already worked with him in American Graffiti and Star Wars. Lucas relented after Tom Selleck was unable to accept.[32] Ford went on to reprise the role throughout the rest of the decade in the prequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and the sequel Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). During the June 1983 filming of Temple of Doom in London, Ford herniated a disc in his back. The 40-year-old actor was forced to fly back to Los Angeles for surgery and returned six weeks later.[33]
Following his leading-man success as Indiana Jones, Ford played Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's dystopian science-fiction film Blade Runner (1982). Compared to his experiences on the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films, Ford had a difficult time with the production. He recalled to Vanity Fair, "It was a long slog. I didn't really find it that physically difficult—I thought it was mentally difficult." Ford and Scott also had differing views on the nature of his character, Deckard, that persist decades later.[34] While not initially a success, Blade Runner became a cult classic and one of Ford's most highly regarded films.[35] Ford proved his versatility throughout the 1980s with dramatic parts in films such as Witness (198

Lina MedinaMedina in 1939BornLina Marcela Medina de Jurado (1933-09-23) 23 September 1933 (age 90)Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna, PeruKnown forYoungest confirmed mother in historySpouseRaúl JuradoChildren2
Lina Marcela Medina de Jurado (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlina meˈðina]; born 23 September 1933)[1] is a Peruvian woman who became the youngest confirmed mother in history when she gave birth on 14 May 1939, aged five years, seven months, and 21 days.[1][2] Based on the medical assessments of her pregnancy, she was four years old when she became pregnant, which was possible due to precocious puberty.[3]
Lina Medina was born in 1933 in Ticrapo, Castrovirreyna Province, Peru,[2] to parents Tiburelo Medina, a silversmith, and Victoria Losea.[4] She was one of nine children.[2]
Her parents took her to a hospital in Pisco at age five due to her increasingly large abdomen.[5] Doctors originally thought she had a tumor but then determined that she was in her seventh month of pregnancy. Dr. Gerardo Lozada had specialists in Lima confirm the pregnancy.[1]
There was widespread interest in the case. The San Antonio Light newspaper in Texas reported in its 16 July 1939 edition that a Peruvian obstetrician and midwife association had demanded she be admitted to a national maternity hospital, and quoted reports in the Peruvian paper La Crónica that an American film studio had sent a representative "with authority to offer the sum of $5,000 to benefit the minor" in return for filming rights, but also said that "we know that the offer was rejected".[6] The article noted that Lozada had made films of Medina for scientific documentation and had shown them while addressing Peru's National Academy of Medicine. Some of the films had fallen into a river on a visit to the girl's hometown, but enough remained to "intrigue the learned savants".[6]
Six weeks after the diagnosis,  on 14 May 1939, Medina gave birth to a boy by caesarean section. She was 5 years, 7 months, and 21 days old,[1] the youngest person in history to give birth. The caesarean birth was necessitated by her small pelvis. The surgery was performed by Lozada and Dr. Busalleu, with Dr. Colareta providing anaesthesia. The doctors found she had fully mature sexual organs from precocious puberty.[2] Dr. Edmundo Escomel reported her case in the medical journal La Presse Médicale, including that her menarche had occurred at eight months of age, in contrast to previous reports that she had had regular periods since the age of three[1][7][8] or two and a half.[2]
Medina's son weighed 2.7 kg (6.0 lb; 0.43 st) at birth and was named Gerardo after her doctor. He was raised believing Medina to be his sister before finding out at age 10 that she was his mother.[1] After initially remaining with the family, Lozada was allowed to take custody of the son at Lozada's home in Lima.  Subsequently, he employed Lina at his clinic in Lima (where she also resided), though Lina was only able to see her son occasionally.[9]  Her son grew up healthy, but died in 1979 at the age of 40 from bone marrow disease.[1][10]
According to Peruvian law, the mere fact of Medina's pregnancy meant that she had been raped at some point before her fifth birthday. Medina has never revealed the identity of the father nor the circumstances of her impregnation. Escomel suggests that she might not know herself, as she "couldn't give precise responses".[1] Lina's father was arrested on suspicion of child sexual abuse but released due to lack of evidence.[1]
In young adulthood, Medina worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, which gave her an education and helped put her son through high school.[11][12] She married and had a second son in 1972.[13] In 2002, she refused an interview with Reuters,[2] just as she had turned away many reporters in years past.[11]
Although it was speculated that the case was a hoax, a number of doctors over the years have verified it based on biopsies, X-rays of the fetal skeleton in utero, and photographs taken by the doctors caring for her.[1][14][15]
There are two published photographs documenting the case. The first was taken around the beginning of April 1939, when Medina was seven and a half months into pregnancy. Taken from her left side, it shows her standing naked in front of a neutral backdrop. It is the only published photograph taken during her pregnancy.[16] Hers is a rare, well-documented case of extreme precocious pregnancy in a child under six.[2][8]

Francesca Mary Unsworth (born 29 December 1957) is a British journalist and media executive. From January 2018 to 2022, she was Director, News & Current Affairs for BBC News.[1][2] She was appointed in succession to James Harding. Before then, she served in various senior positions in the BBC, including director of the BBC World Service Group. Previously, she was acting director of News at the BBC from November 2012 until August 2013 and a member of the BBC's executive board. In 2013, she was appointed deputy director of News and Current Affairs.[3]
Early life and education
Unsworth was born on 1957 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.[4] She attended St Dominic's High School, Stoke-on-Trent, a direct grant grammar school.[3][5] She studied drama at the University of Manchester but was unable to get into a drama school and so switched careers to publishing in London.[6]
BBC career
Unsworth began her broadcasting career in local radio, working at BBC Radio Leicester and BBC Radio Bristol, before going on to become producer of Radio 1's Newsbeat. In 1990, she moved to Radio 4 and was based in Washington as a radio producer for the network during the Gulf crisis of 1990–1991. She worked as a producer on The World at One and PM while at Radio 4.[7]
She moved to the BBC's Newsgathering Department in 1993, where she had responsibility for UK domestic news, and was a producer and editor for the BBC One O'Clock News and the BBC Six O'Clock News. Unsworth was appointed Head of Newsgathering in January 2005.[8]
In December 2005, Unsworth appeared on the BBC's Newswatch programme, responding to accusations of double standards in BBC News reporting of racial crimes when white people were the victims. Complainants suggested the BBC buried stories such as the racist murder of Kriss Donald, with comparable murders involving black victims given twelve times more coverage and the opening of an arts centre in Gateshead reported in preference to Donald's murder. Unsworth admitted the case had not been covered sufficiently and that there had been space to do so.[9] Her department again failed to cover the case adequately the following year.[10][11] In 2011, BBC News was criticised for referring to looters in the 2011 London riots as "protesters", even two days into the violence.[12] In response to 62 complaints about the matter, Unsworth conceded that the BBC had been wrong to do so.[13]
In November 2012, Unsworth was appointed acting director of News after Helen Boaden stepped aside while Nick Pollard prepared his report into the BBC's non-coverage of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal.[14][15] She ceased working in this role in August 2013 and was appointed deputy director of News and Current Affairs.[3] In November 2013, Unsworth was replaced as Head of Newsgathering by Jonathan Munro.[16]
In August 2014, Unsworth ordered helicopter filming of a police raid on a mansion belonging to singer Cliff Richard. The coverage led to Richard suing the BBC for breach of privacy.[17] On 8 May 2018, The Guardian reported: "Sir Cliff Richard is seeking a payment of at least £560,000 from the BBC following the broadcaster's coverage of a police raid at his home in 2014." In July, Richard was awarded £210,000 in damages and the BBC agreed to pay £2 million in legal costs. Unsworth apologised to Richard and stated that "there were elements of its coverage that should have been handled differently" but criticised the ruling as an attack on liberty and press freedoms.[18][19]
In January 2018, she was invited to present evidence at a parliamentary select committee meeting on gender pay gap at the BBC. This was initiated by the resignation of the then China editor Carrie Gracie in the same month over the same issue. Unsworth defended the pay gap between Grace and the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel as Sopel was "on air twice as much" and that "The China job [is] a more features-based agenda".[20] Gracie also reported that Unsworth had privately commented to a colleague that the pay gap was due to her being part-time.[21] Unsworth denied this stating "I did the contract, I knew she wasn't" but apologised to her for causing a 'misunderstanding' due to 'loose' language.[22] BBC and Gracie agreed to an equal pay deal in June 2018 and she donated the back pay awarded to charity.[23]
In September 2021, it was announced that Unsworth will leave the BBC in 2022 after 40 years.[24]
Other roles
Unsworth was president of the Society of Editors between 2011 and 2012, and is a board member of the organisation.[25][26][27] She is also a board member of the European Union's Erasmus Mundus programme.[28]

Anushka Sharma (pronounced [əˈnʊʃka ˈʃərma]; born 1 May 1988) is an Indian actress who works in Hindi films. She has received several awards, including a Filmfare Award. One of the highest-paid actresses in India as of 2018,[1] she has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 since 2012 and was featured by Forbes Asia in their 30 Under 30 list of 2018.[2]
Born in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. She made her acting debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the top-grossing romantic film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) and rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); winning the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. Sharma went on to earn praise for playing strong-willed women in the crime thriller NH10 (2015), and the dramas Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), and Sui Dhaaga (2018). Her highest-grossing releases came with the sports drama Sultan (2016), and Rajkumar Hirani's films PK (2014) and Sanju (2018). This was followed by a hiatus from acting.
Sharma was the co-founder of the production company Clean Slate Filmz, under which she produced several films and web series, including NH10 and Paatal Lok (2020). She is the ambassador for brands and products, has designed her own line of clothing for women, named Nush, and supports various charities and causes, including gender equality and animal rights. Sharma is married to the cricketer Virat Kohli, with whom she has two children.[3][4]
Anushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.[5][6][7] Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker.[7][8] Her ancestral home is in Dehradun town of Uttarakhand on Naishvilla road, her father lived here before joining the Indian army. Anushka Sharma's grandmother Urmila still lives in their house. Sharma lived in Sheela Bhawan of Naishvilla road in her childhood.[9]
Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali.[10][11] Her elder brother is film producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy.[12] Sharma has stated that being a military brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life.[7] In an interview with The Times of India in 2012, she said, "I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor."[7]
Sharma was raised in Bangalore.[7] But she did her primary schooling at St. Mary's School, Margherita, Assam. Sakshi Dhoni, the wife of M.S Dhoni, was her classmate in that school.[13] She completed her schooling at Army School, Bangalore. Then she did her graduation in arts from Mount Carmel College, Bangalore.[14][15]
She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress.[14] After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career.[16] She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa.[citation needed] In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection.[16] Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio.[citation needed] Sharma later said, "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used to say, 'give us a blank look.' It was really difficult, not to smile".[16] Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles.[17][18]
Sharma made her acting debut in Aditya Chopra's romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), opposite Shah Rukh Khan. She took a day to prepare for her screen test at the Yash Raj Films studio and refused to do an impromptu one.[16] She was signed for a three-film deal with the company and landed the leading role of Tani Sahni, a young bride to a middle-aged man, portrayed by Khan. Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times found her to be "assured and upright" in the film,[19] but Nikhat Kazmi thought that she "lacks all chutzpah and can barely hold your attention".[20] The film was a major commercial success, emerging as the second-highest grossing Hindi film of that year,[21] and earned Sharma Filmfare Award nominations for Best Actress and Best Female Debut.[22] Two years later, Sharma played the leading lady in the crime-comedy Badmaash Company, directed by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, which tells the story of four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, received mixed reviews.[23]
Later in 2010, Sharma completed her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films by starring in Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh.[24] Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as the toughest part of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as "crude but cute" and it required her to "talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely".[25] Trade analysts expressed doubt on Band Baaja Baaraat's financial prospect, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star, and saying that by then Sharma was an "almost-forgotten" actress.[26] However, Band Baaja Baaraat earned positive reviews and emerged as a sleeper hit.[27] Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best work to that point.[28] The critic Anupama Chopra wrote that Sharma "comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings".[29] For her work in the film, Sharma received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.[30]
Sharma's first venture not to be produced by Yash Raj Films was the drama Patiala House (2011) directed by Nikkhil Advani and co-starring Akshay Kumar.[31] The film tells the story of a budding cricketer (played by Kumar) who encounters trouble in convincing his father of his profession; Sharma was cast as the love interest of Kumar's character. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised Sharma's work and labelled her a "metaphor for energy".[32] That same year, she re-united with co-star Ranveer Singh and director Maneesh Sharma for the comedy-drama Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. She featured as Ishika Desai, a salesgirl hired to outwit a conman (essayed by Singh), who ends up falling in love with him instead. The film and Sharma's performance received mixed reviews, with Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV calling her "believable but not endearing".[33] Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate success at the box office.[citation needed]
In 2012, Sharma played a supporting role alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif in Yash Chopra's "swan song", the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films and her second with Khan. She was cast as Akira Rai, a Discovery Channel reporter who harbours ambitions of being a documentary filmmaker. Rajeev Masand wrote that Sharma "brings a spark to the film",[34] but Raja Sen disagreed and said that "while Anushka can indeed play spunky, she needed here to tone it down several notches".[35] For her role, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[36] Jab Tak Hai Jaan proved to be the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2012.[37]
Sharma next appeared in Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola (2013), a political satire set in a village in Haryana. Co-starring alongside Pankaj Kapur, Imran Khan and Shabana Azmi, Sharma played the titular role of Bijlee Mandola, a strong-headed girl who engages in a romantic affair with Khan's character despite being engaged to another man. The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics,[38] and underperformed at the box office.[39][40] Several critics noted that Sharma was being stereotyped as a loud and loquacious girl; Raja Sen noted that she "is great in a couple of scenes near the climax,"[41] though Kanika Sikka of Daily News and Analysis was more critical and found her "unconvincing".[42]
In 2014, Sharma played a television journalist who befriends an alien (played by Aamir Khan), in Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire PK. Critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Sharma plays "a feisty poetry-loving girl who knows her mind far more than most Hindi film heroines are allowed to" and praised her for "hold[ing] her own" against Khan.[43] Critically acclaimed, PK emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film with a worldwide revenue of over ₹7 billion (US$88 million).[44][45] Sharma received various accolades for her performance including a nomination for IIFA Award for Best Actress.[46] Sharma also became the highest grossing Hindi film actress of the year, as reported by Bollywood Hungama.[47] Sharma launched a production company named Clean Slate Filmz in 2013, whose first release was Navdeep Singh's thriller NH10 (2015), in which she also played the lead role.[48] Screened at the 5th Beijing International Film Festival, it tells the story of a married couple whose lives are endangered after an encounter with a group of criminals.[49] In preparation, Sharma underwent interval training for three months to build her stamina.[50] Saibal Chatterjee found the film to be a "taut and riveting thriller" and praised Sharma for "conveying a range of moods as she moves from the vulnerable to the fearless in a battle in which the odds are stacked heavily against her",[51] and Prarthana Sarkar of International Business Times credited her for breaking away from her romantic comedy image.[52] The film also emerged as a box office success.[53]

Personal detailsBorn (1957-09-29) 29 September 1957 (age 66)Nagpur, Bombay State, IndiaSpouseVarsha[1]Children1
Shashank Venkatesh Manohar (/ʃəˈʃɑːŋk məˈnoʊhər/; born 29 September 1957)[2] is a prominent[3] Indian lawyer and cricket administrator. He twice served as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, from 2008 to 2011,[4] and again from November 2015 to May 2016.[5][6] He served as the chairman of the International Cricket Council from November 2015 to March 2017.[7] On 24 March 2017, a resolution was passed to reinstate him as the chairman until a successor was elected.
Board of Control for Cricket in India Presidency - First term, 2008–11
During his presidency, India became the number-one-ranked Test side and won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final.[8] In June 2010, he suspended IPL commissioner and BCCI vice president Lalit Modi for his misdemeanors relating to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala IPL franchise.[9][10] Before being president of BCCI, he was president of Vidarbha Cricket Association.[11]
Response to the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing saga
Manohar lashed out at the players involved in the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing and betting case and said that every match in the ongoing season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) should be investigated.[12][13] It was widely speculated that he would be given the interim charge of the BCCI in the aftermath of the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing case.[14][15][16][17][18] But he refused to be the caretaker chief of BCCI, if N. Srinivasan continues in his role as the BCCI president.[19][20] He had told BCCI vice-president Arun Jaitley in clear terms before 2 June 2013 working committee meeting that he was "not interested" in taking charge of the Board on an ad-hoc basis because such an ad hoc appointment is void as per the BCCI constitution. The BCCI constitution does not have a provision for Dual Presidency.[21][22]
Allegations of foreign exchange violations in IPL 2009
In June 2013 the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sent him a notice for adjudication issued against him over allegations of foreign exchange violations in the IPL tournament held in South Africa in 2009, for which he approached the Bombay High Court challenging the notice. His counsel told the Bombay High Court that Lalit Modi who was chairman IPL and vice-president BCCI during IPL in 2009 took all major decisions after approval from the BCCI committee. Modi could have received his first 'reprimand' from Manohar back in March 2010, but former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, then a member of the Governing Council, requested that the 'reprimand' not be recorded.[23] Manohar had advised the IPL governing council to first take permission from RBI and only then open an account in South Africa.[24] In response, the Bombay High Court quashed and set aside the notice issued by Enforcement Directorate (ED).[25]
BCCI elections September 2013
Even though a majority of members wanted Srinivasan out and had the numbers to do so, they were rendered powerless by a technicality. Srinivasan had all but made sure he will be elected unopposed as his rivals didn't have a proposer and seconder from South Zone for their candidate. Under BCCI rules, a contender for the top post must have the endorsement of at least two units from the zone whose turn it is to elect the president.[26]
Manohar tore apart Srinivasan in an interview to the tabloid Mumbai Mirror on 3 October 2013. He said that as Srinivasan was responsible for the mess in BCCI, he should not be BCCI president any more. He further said "Srinivasan has no right to continue as president. If you had the slightest of conscience, self-esteem and care for the board, you ought to have put in your papers the moment your son-in-law (Gurunath Meiyappan) was arrested [for betting in IPL. You did nothing and, as a result, the board's reputation has taken a hit to the extent that the people have lost faith in this board." He concluded by saying: "I left the board two years back and I have not entered its premises again. I have no intention to come back. I said if all the members want me, I will not shirk the responsibility. This board has given me a lot and I was willing to give something back."[27][28]
April 2014 BCCI emergent Working committee meeting
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called an emergent working committee meeting in Mumbai on Sunday, 20 April 2014, to decide its future course of action following the Supreme Court's order that forced Srinivasan to step aside as the cricket board's president. The meeting was called after several state associations wrote to the BCCI interim president (administration) Shivlal Yadav, demanding a discussion on the ongoing issues. Many state cricket association members think that only Shashank Manohar can restore cricket board's credibility. They wanted Manohar to lend his voice to their unhappiness at the meeting.
After attending the Working Committee meeting as a representative of Vidarbha Cricket Association, Manohar said "I can't disclose what happened at the meeting. All I can say is I was disillusioned with the happenings. I had gone there with the purpose of cleaning up the image of the Board in public domain, but I was disillusioned."[29]
Manohar was outvoted 14–1 at the meeting for the appointment of three-member inquiry panel. Manohar alleged the committee appointed Srinivasan's "cronies" to investigate his own wrongdoings in the board.[29][30]
Manohar had said in the April 2014 Working committee meeting that Justice Mudgal who is completely unbiased and can effectively probe the scam with the help of CBI instead of the 3 members elected by Srinivasan's cronies.[31]
On 22 April 2014 the Supreme Court of India endorsed Manohar's view and rejected BCCI's proposed panel to probe the IPL scam, asked Mudgal committee if it can help probe the scam with the help of CBI.[29]
Justice Mudgal Committee report in the IPL corruption scandal
In April 2014 the Supreme Court of India appointed probe commission headed by (Retd) Justice Mukul Mudgal  to investigate the betting and match fixing scandal in the IPL. The committee also included Additional Solicitor General L Nageswara Rao, advocate Nilay Datta, Deputy DG (Narcotics Control Bureau) BB Mishra, Vidushpat Singhania (Secretary) and the police departments in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai to assist the investigation.
N.Srinivasan named in the Mudgal Committee Report
In November 2014 in response to the final submission of the Mudgal Committee Report, a special bench of the Supreme Court of India comprising justice TS Thakur and FM Kalifullah has named and issued notices to four key individuals including N Srinivasan and Gurunath Meiyappan in connection with the Mudgal report into the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case, which, the court observed, had suggested several "misdemeanours" by the duo.
In view of the court's observation, Manohar urged the BCCI member associations to take a stance. "The image of the Board is tarnished by the actions and the attitude of Mr Srinivasan. The gentlemen's game, as the game of cricket has long been known, and the reputation of the Board is at its lowest due to the egoistic and autocratic behaviour of one individual. The Board and the game of Cricket is bigger than any individual and it is the responsibility and duty of every individual connected with the game to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Game and the Board, and through this press note, I appeal to all members of the Board to rise to the occasion and prevent the Board and the Game from being further destroyed."
Manohar said on 14 November that the BCCI was flouting its own constitution by repeatedly putting off its Annual General Meeting that should have been held before 30 September. "It appears that during today's hearing, as soon as the names of Srinivasan and Meiyappan were disclosed, the counsel for the BCCI made a request for the postponement of the AGM and elections scheduled on November 20," Manohar said.
"It is thus evident that the instructions given to the Board counsel are only with an intent to suit Srinivasan as that would ensure that he still remains a back-seat driver," said Manohar. The AGM has been postponed by four weeks, the second time it has been deferred, a first in BCCI's history!
The then former BCCI president argued that since the Supreme Court has named Srinivasan and his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, it means there are allegations of corruption against them in the report. Yet Srinivasan remote controls the BCCI, complained Manohar.
It had been widely said that Manohar may once again reform a new axis that could challenge Srinivasan's juggernaut in BCCI in the upcoming AGM.[32][33][34]
Board of Control for Cricket in India Presidency - Second term, 2015–16
Second innings as BCCI chief
Less than 24 hours after refusing to be part of any alliance involving Srinivasan, Manohar emerged as the clear favourite to succeed the late Jagmohan Dalmiya as the president.
According to media reports, Manohar's candidature had been endorsed by Sharad Pawar, Arun Jaitley and his protege Anurag Thakur, the BCCI secretary. Manohar, who has a squeaky clean image and a no-nonsense approach to administration, soon emerged as the favourite. However, he has repeatedly refused to enter the poll fray after completing his term as BCCI president in 2011, given the mess in the board. Manohar changed his mind only after Arun Jaitley and Sharad Pawar both endorsed his candidature. With Rajiv Shukla too throwing his weight behind Manohar, the forthcoming SGM may not even see a contest.

<s> Nikki SixxSixx in September 2007Background informationBirth nameFrank Carlton Serafino Feranna Jr.Born (1958-12-11) December 11, 1958 (age 65)San Jose, California, U.S.Genres
Nikki Sixx (born Frank Carlton Serafino Feranna Jr.;[1][2] December 11, 1958) is an American musician, best known as the co-founder, bassist, and primary songwriter of the heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, being the only member to remain throughout their entire history.[1] Prior to forming Mötley Crüe, Sixx was a member of Sister before going on to form London[1] with his Sister bandmate Lizzie Grey.[3] In 2000, he formed side project group 58 with Dave Darling, Steve Gibb and Bucket Baker, issuing one album, Diet for a New America. Also in 2002,[4] he formed the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns.[5] Formed in 2006, initially to record an audio accompaniment to Sixx's autobiography The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star,[6] his side band Sixx:A.M. featured songwriter, producer, and vocalist James Michael and guitarist DJ Ashba.[6]
Sixx has also worked with a number of artists and groups, co-writing and/or producing songs, such as Sex Pistols's guitarist Steve Jones, Lita Ford, Alice Cooper,[1] Meat Loaf,[7] Marion Raven,[8][9] Drowning Pool,[10] Saliva and The Last Vegas, among others.
Sixx launched the clothing line "Royal Underground" in 2006 with Kelly Gray, formerly the co-president and house model of St. John.[11] Initially the label concentrated on men's clothing[12] before expanding into women's apparel.[13] In 2010, Premiere Radio Networks launched nationally syndicated rock/alternative music radio programs "Sixx Sense" and "The Side Show Countdown" with both based in Dallas, Texas and hosted by Sixx and co-hosted by Jenn Marino.[14]
Frank Carlton Serafino Feranna Jr. was born on December 11, 1958, in San Jose, California.[1][15][16] He is of Italian descent on his father's side, from  Prato, Tuscany. Sixx was partially raised by his single mother, Deana Richards, and by his grandparents after his father left the family.[1] Feranna later moved in with his grandparents after his mother abandoned him. Feranna relocated several times while living with his grandparents.[17] Feranna's uncle, husband of Deana's sister Sharon, is Don Zimmerman, producer and president of Capitol Records. Feranna had one full biological sister, Lisa, (born with Down syndrome; died circa 2000)[18] and has one half-brother Rodney Anthony Feranna (born 1966) and a half-sister Ceci.[19]
Feranna grew up listening to Deep Purple, Harry Nilsson, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Queen, and Black Sabbath; he later discovered T. Rex, David Bowie, and Slade.[20] While living in Jerome, Idaho, Feranna's youth was troubled; he became a teenage vandal, broke into neighbors' homes, shoplifted, and was expelled from school for selling drugs. His grandparents sent him to live with his mother, who had moved to Seattle.[21] Feranna lived there for a short time and learned how to play the bass guitar, having bought his first instrument with money gained from selling a guitar he had stolen.[1]
At the age of 17, Feranna moved to Los Angeles and worked menial jobs such as working at a liquor store[1] and selling vacuum cleaners over the phone[1] while he auditioned for bands. He eventually joined the band Sister,[1] led by Blackie Lawless,[22] after answering an ad in The Recycler for a bass player.[23] Soon after recording a demo, Feranna was fired from Sister[23] along with bandmate Lizzie Grey.[3]
Feranna and Grey formed the band London soon afterward, in 1978.[3][23] During this time, Feranna legally changed his name to Nikki Sixx.[1][23] After a number of lineup changes, London added former Mott the Hoople singer Nigel Benjamin to the group, and recorded a 16-track demo in Burbank.[23] After the departure of Benjamin, along with the failure to find a replacement, Sixx departed London.[23] The group would go on to feature Sixx's former Sister bandmate Blackie Lawless (later of W.A.S.P.),[23] Izzy Stradlin (then of Hollywood Rose, later of Guns N' Roses) and drummer Fred Coury (later of Cinderella). In 2000, a number of the London demos recorded with Sixx were included on London Daze by Spiders & Snakes, led by former London guitarist Lizzie Grey.[3]
In 1981, Sixx founded Mötley Crüe alongside drummer Tommy Lee. They were later joined by guitarist Mick Mars through an ad in the local newspaper, and singer Vince Neil, with whom Lee had attended high school.[1][7] The band self-recorded their debut album, Too Fast for Love, which was subsequently released in November 1981 on the band's own Leathür Records label. After signing with Elektra Records, they re-released the same album.[1] The band then went on to record and release Shout at the Devil, raising the band to national fame.[1][7] They issued three more albums during the 1980s, Theatre of Pain in 1985, Girls, Girls, Girls in 1987,[1][7] and Dr. Feelgood in 1989. The latter ended up being their most successful record,[1][7] staying in the charts for 114 weeks after its release. The duo of Sixx and Lee are called the "Terror Twins".[24][25]
During his time with Mötley Crüe, Sixx became addicted to heroin. He is quoted in The Heroin Diaries as saying: "Alcohol, acid, cocaine... they were just affairs. When I met heroin it was true love." He estimates he overdosed "about half a dozen times".[1][26] On December 23, 1987, Sixx overdosed on heroin and was reportedly declared clinically dead for two minutes before a paramedic revived him with two syringes full of adrenaline.[27]

After releasing the compilation album Decade of Decadence in 1991, Neil left the group, and was replaced by John Corabi, who formerly served with The Scream. They released one self titled album with Corabi, in 1994, before firing him in 1996. Afterwards, they reunited with Neil, with whom they released Generation Swine in 1997.[7]
Sixx had become controversial for an incident during a Mötley Crüe concert at Greensboro Coliseum on October 30, 1997, in which he used racial epithets while goading the audience to physically attack a black security guard for repeatedly attacking a female fan.[28] In May 2001, Sixx addressed the issue, and claimed he had apologized to the victim of the incident.[29]
In 1999, Tommy Lee left the group to form Methods of Mayhem. He was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo, with whom they released the album New Tattoo in 2000.[7] The group went on hiatus soon afterward before reuniting in 2004, during which Sixx declared himself sober. A 2001 autobiography entitled The Dirt packaged the band as "the world's most notorious rock band". The book made the top ten on The New York Times Best Seller list and spent ten weeks there.[7]
In 2006, Mötley Crüe completed a reunion tour, featuring all four original members,[7] and embarked on a co-headlining tour with Aerosmith, called The Route of All Evil. In April 2008, the band announced the first Crüe Fest, a summer tour, that featured Sixx's side project Sixx:A.M., Buckcherry, Papa Roach and Trapt.[30] On June 24, 2008, Mötley Crüe released their ninth studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, with Sixx credited as either writer or co-writer on all tracks.[citation needed]
Sixx wrote most of Mötley Crüe's material, including tracks such as "Live Wire", "Home Sweet Home", "Girls, Girls, Girls", "Kickstart My Heart", "Wild Side", "Hooligan's Holiday" and "Dr. Feelgood". In the 1990s, all four members began contributing to the material on the albums.[citation needed]
In 2000, Sixx formed the internet-based side project 58 with producer Dave Darling, guitarist Steve Gibb (formerly of Black Label Society and Crowbar) and drummer Bucket Baker.[4] They released one single, titled "Piece of Candy", and their debut album, Diet for a New America, also in 2000 through Sixx's Americoma label and Beyond Records.[4] The group did not tour, and was described by Sixx as "strictly an artistic thing."[29]
Brides of Destruction were formed by Sixx[7] and Tracii Guns[2] in Los Angeles 2002 initially with the name Cockstar[5][31] after Mötley Crüe went on hiatus and Guns left L.A. Guns. Sixx also invited former Beautiful Creatures guitarist DJ Ashba to join the group however he declined to focus on his solo band, ASHBA. Ashba would eventually join Sixx in Sixx:A.M.[32]
After a few lineup changes, that included Sixx's former Mötley Crüe bandmate John Corabi,[5] keyboardist Adam Hamilton[5] and drummer Kris Kohls of Adema,[5][33] the group was composed of Sixx, Guns, singer London LeGrand and drummer Scot Coogan formerly of Ednaswap and Annetenna.[5]
They were advised by radio programmers that the name Cockstar would not be announced on air.[31] They briefly adopted the moniker Motordog before settling on Brides of Destruction.[31][34][35]
They entered the studio with producer Stevo Bruno to begin recording what would become Here Come the Brides. The Brides played their first show opening for Mudvayne and Taproot on November 14, 2002, at the Ventura Theatre in California.[36][37]
After signing a deal with Sanctuary Records,[5][38][39] the group released Here Come the Brides in 2004, with the album debuting at number 92 on the Billboard 200[40] selling over 13,000 copies.[41] A tour of the US, Europe, including an appearance at Download Festival in the United Kingdom,[42] and Australia followed.
On October 25, 2004, it was announced that the group were to go on hiatus while Sixx reunited with Mötley Crüe for a reunion tour.[7][43] The group continued without Sixx, however, with Guns adding former Amen bassist Scott Sorry to the group as Sixx's replacement.[44] The second Brides of Destruction album, titled Runaway Brides, released in 2005 featured three songs co-written by Sixx during the Here Come the Brides sessions.[45]
Sixx formed his own group Sixx:A.M. in 2006, to record an audio accompaniment to his autobiography The Heroin D

María Elena Medina-Mora Icaza (born 3 October 1951) is a Mexican researcher and psychologist. Medina-Mora Icaza was inducted into El Colegio Nacional on 6 March 2006.[1]
Early life and education
Medina-Mora Icaza was born on 3 October 1951, in Mexico City. She obtained her primary education at the Colegio Francés del Pedregal from 1955-1961. She attended Palos Verdes & Margate School for junior high school from 1962-1963. She then returned to the French College of Pedregal for high school (1964-1970). Following high school, she obtained licensure to practice social and clinical psychology (1970-1974).[2] Once licensed, she obtained her Bachelor of Psychology (1976) and her Masters in Psychology (1979) at the Ibero-American University. In 1993, she obtained her Ph.D. in social psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and later received an honorary Ph.D. from the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon (2009).[3]
Career
Medina-Mora Icaza is an expert in mental health, addiction, and is a faculty member of UNAM’s medical and psychology departments. Furthermore, she has been working with the Mexican government since 2003. She was the director of the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muñiz and worked with the Secretary of Health from 2008-2018.[1] The day after stepping down from the director position at the National Institute of Psychiatry, she was promoted to the coordinator position. In addition, as of 2019, she is the director of the mental health and psychiatric department at UNAM.[2]
Medina-Mora Icaza works as a level three researcher with the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores and is a member of the El Colegio Nacional, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine (Academia Nacional de Medicina), and the National College of Psychologists (Colegio Nacional de Psicólogos). Medina-Mora Icaza also serves in the editorial committee for the following journals: Mental Health (Salud Mental), the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Mexican Magazine of Psychology and Public Health, Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, Addiction (UK), and Psychiatry (Spain).[1]
Since becoming the director of the psychology department at UNAM, Medina-Mora Icaza has proposed implementing new policies. Her most notable policy is the ‘’Zero Tolerance’’ policy in regards to gender violence.[4]
Research
Some of her most recent research has focused on how COVID-19 and quarantining have affected the mental health of the Mexican populace. She has warned that mental illness cases are on the rise, and with that in mind, about 30% of the population has yet to receive governmental aid. This is likely attributed to the fact that the Secretary of Health only channels 2.2% of their resources into the treatment of mental health.[5] Medina-Mora Icaza also mentions how a good number of COVID-19 survivivors experience outcomes ranging from delusions, psychosis, and even serious neurological disorders. Other common lingering ailments due to COVID-19 include headaches, altered consciousness, convulsions, and the absence of taste and smell. She has found that the prevalence of anxiety disorders and antisocial behaviors is greatest among youth between 12 and 17 years of age, which also happens to be the same demographic that is second in the consumption of drugs. Furthermore, the prevalence of mental disorders has increased among those between 18 and 26 years of age. She warns that merely treating mental illness alone isn’t enough, we must also strive to remedy the social determinants that cause mental illness.[6]

Matthew Tukaki was the United Nations Global Compact's Australian Representative from 2010 until 2013. In 2012, he led Australia's business delegation to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20).[2] In May 2013, he was officially appointed by United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, as an ex officio director of the board of the United Nations Global Compact. In that same month, he was also elected as the chairperson of the United Nations Global Compact's Local Network Advisory Group;[3] he states that he retired from these roles in November 2013, and denies press reports that he was asked to resign due to "an alleged serious breach of Director's Duties".[4] He was the first person to be elected as Australian representative, and the first person to be appointed by the secretary general in the role of LN Representative on the governing board of the UNGC. He was also the first Australian / New Zealander and the first person of Māori descent.
Tukaki has been active in his support for business and industry to play a larger role when it comes to sustainable development and the United Nations Post 2015 Agenda. In an interview with Radio New Zealand in September 2013, Tukaki also indicated a strong desire for business to play a primary role in developing technological advances as a way to solve some of the "big challenges of our time". Tukaki retired from his role as Australian Representative to the United Nations Global Compact in November 2013.
In his memoir, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. Vice Chair of the United Nations Global Compact and former chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, recognised Tukaki's work and leadership during the reform process after he was elected as chairman of the Local Networks Advisory Group. The significance of the reform agenda led to a range of new initiatives being developed such as a new collaborative fundraising framework, deeper engagement with transnational and multinational corporations, and a frontier fund to help United Nations Global Compact Networks with material and financial support.
In February 2014, Tukaki announced the formation of a new global initiative to be known as EntreHub. The organisation was formed to support budding entrepreneurs with a target of having 100,000 people involved in the conversation by the end of 2014. EntreHub announced in January 2015 that there were now more than 50,000 members located across 130 countries.
Broadcasting and radio
In 2016, Tukaki joined 2UE Talking Lifestyle network as co-host of the "Talking Lifestyle; Second Career"[5] radio show. Initially, the show was broadcast from 9 pm to 11 pm before moving to run through to midnight. Tukaki also co-hosted the afternoon slot with Ed Phillips between 3 and 4 pm and is a regular across the network on the Morning Mix and Breakfast show. Tukaki became a solo host in December 2016 when the network undertook a programme change. In the 2017, a survey showed Tukaki's show was one of the few that went up the ratings period. In April 2018, Tukaki signed off[6] from the 2UE Radio Network for the last time after the network announced it would become a 24-hour sports broadcaster. Tukaki stated publicly he did not want to make the transition.
New Zealand Māori Council and the National Māori Authority

In November 2017, Tukaki was appointed into the role of executive chairman of the National Māori Authority, Ngā Ngaru Rautahi O Aotearoa. In 2018, Tukaki also became the chair of the Auckland District Māori Council, one of the sixteen Districts of the New Zealand Māori Council. In July, Tukaki was elected to the National Executive of the New Zealand Māori Council with a clear agenda on moving the council towards leading the national social policy debate. This new agenda began to emerge across a number of fronts including suicide prevention, homelessness and the affordability of life extending and life saving drugs for Māori. The latter was the first call to the Māori Affairs Select Committee of the New Zealand Parliament in its history. He was then appointed Executive Director of the Council.[7] Tukaki was not re-elected to the Auckland District Council in the following, 2021, triennial election and became ineligible to continue as Executive Director. Tukaki continued to operate in the role for some months as he challenged the result in the High Court over apparent irregularities in the election, however he was unsuccessful, with the Court recommending the allegations be instead dealt with by the Māori Council's own processes.[8] Tukaki has been involved in a large number of public, social, and economic policy areas across the Māori world.
Ministry for Children (Oranga Tamariki)
In January 2021, the New Zealand Government announced that Tukaki has been appointed Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Board of Oranga Tamariki with fellow Board Members being Dame Naida Glavish, Sir Mark Solomon, and Shannon Pakura.[9] In doing so, the Government announced that Tukaki would lead a broad reaching review of the Agency to report by 30 June 2021. Oranga Tamariki, also known as the Ministry for Children, is responsible for New Zealand's care and protection system as well as the youth justice sector. Tukaki is also Chair of the New Zealand Ministry of Health's Māori Health Monitoring Group and leads the negotiations into radio spectrum on behalf of Māori with the Crown.
On 29 September 2021, Tukaki was joined by New Zealand Minister for Children, Kelvin Davis, for the [10] launch of a report into the child protection system in that country called [11] Kahu Aroha. The New Zealand Government accepted all of the recommendations contained in the report and further announced that the Board Tukaki Chairs (with members being Dame Naida Glavish, Sir Mark Solomon and former Chief Social Worker, Shannon Pakura) would monitor their implementation. Crucially, the recommendations include establishing permanent governance arrangements of the Ministry, devolution of resources, and decision making to communities. The report is being recognised as the single largest overhaul in the sector in a generation and comes off the back of the establishment of a Royal Commission into Abuse in Care due to report in 2023.
Other activities
Software business patents dispute: In 2003, Tukaki courted controversy and widespread support, when he joined with Senator John Tierney in what was described as a battle of common sense[12][13] with American company, DE Technologies. Tukaki and Senator Tierney challenged the patent holder to show cause and credibility of why they were targeting Australian companies for a percentage of the transaction value of payments made over the internet. The dispute was later resolved and is recognised as being a turning point in how software method patents are dealt with. As a result, no Australian companies or organisations were impacted by the enforcement of the patents under question.
Employment and the Global Financial Crisis: At the height of the Global Financial Crisis, Tukaki was cautious in his assessment of what the impacts would be on jobs and employment, particularly in Australia. In 2010, he told the Sydney Morning Herald that employers were more concerned about skill shortages in some professions and that the "usual December slowdown had failed to arrive".[14] This was different to a year earlier where he had told an online news service, "The significance of underemployment is still not statistically understood and is usually where an employee may have moved from permanent work to casual or part-time work, with many moving to two part-time jobs on less salary than the previous full-time job."[15] Throughout 2010 and into 2011, the cautious approach of looking at where jobs were being created and the changing dynamic of the labour market led Tukaki to become known as one of the most influential employment figures in the region.
Role in suicide prevention and mental health: After joining the Board of Suicide Prevention Australia in 2010, Tukaki played an active role in the restructuring of the organisation as it developed a new strategy to halve suicide in Australia within a decade. He chaired the initial meetings that led to the formation of Australia's first coalition to undertake that task and has chaired the annual Life Awards since 2010 that acknowledge the contribution of individuals and organisations in the community who are actively working towards reducing stigma, providing support and prevention projects. In June 2014 he told Australia's Channel 9 "It's tough out there for so many in the community and we need to take stock of whether or not we are doing all we can to support not just young people but also our older population, those in rural and remote communities because unless we start having these conversations the black dog (referring to depression) will always chase us around the room." In 2015 Tukaki was appointed chairman of Australia's National Coalition for Suicide Prevention. On 28 November Tukaki was elected as the chair of the Board of Suicide Prevention, replacing Murray Bleach.
Tukaki has been heavily associated with business and anti-corruption, telling Radio Australia in 2012 that "There is this false understanding that in order to win a contract in a foreign country, particularly in Asia and the subcontinent, or to do business, you somehow have to pay a bribe".
[16] He is well known for his work when it comes to change management in both the private and public sectors as well as his view around the connection between sustainable development, business, and industry.

Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (Arabic: أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن, romanized: Usāma bin Muḥammad bin ʿAwaḍ bin Lādin; 10 March 1957 – 2 May 2011) was a Saudi-born Islamic dissident and militant leader who was the founder and first general emir of al-Qaeda from 1988 until his death in 2011. Ideologically a pan-Islamist, he participated in the Afghan Jihad against the Soviet Union and supported the activities of the Bosnian mujahideen during the Yugoslav Wars. Bin Laden is most widely known as the mastermind of the September 11 attacks in the United States.
Osama was born in Riyadh to the aristocratic bin Laden family. He studied at local universities until 1979, when he joined the Afghan mujahidin against the Soviet Union in the wake of the Afghan–Soviet War. In 1984, he co-founded Maktab al-Khidamat which recruited foreign mujahidin into the war. He founded al-Qaeda in 1988 for worldwide jihad. In the Gulf War (1990–1991), Bin Laden's offer for support against Iraq was rebuked by the Saudi royal family, which instead sought American aid. Bin Laden's views on pan-Islamism and anti-Americanism resulted in his expulsion from Saudi Arabia in 1991. He subsequently shifted his headquarters to Sudan until 1996 when he left the country to establish a new base in Afghanistan, where he was supported by the Taliban. Bin Laden declared two fatawa, the first in August 1996, and the second in February 1998, declaring holy war against the United States. He orchestrated the 1998 United States embassy bombings in East Africa. He was then listed on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists and Most Wanted Fugitives lists. In October 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization.
Bin Laden was the organizer of the September 11 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. This resulted in the United States invading Afghanistan, which launched the war on terror. Bin Laden became the subject of nearly a decade-long multi-national manhunt led by the United States. During this period, he hid in several mountainous regions of Afghanistan and later escaped to neighboring Pakistan. On 2 May 2011, Bin Laden was killed by U.S. special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad. His corpse was buried at the Arabian Sea and he was officially succeeded by his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri on 16 June 2011.
Bin Laden grew to become a highly influential ideologue in the Islamic world. He was considered a war hero due to his role in successfully opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and offered an articulate voice and organizational structure to many across the region harboring grievances against Western imperialism, often having approval ratings in some countries higher than those of national leaders. Nonetheless, his justification and orchestration of attacks against civilian targets in the United States, including the September 11 attacks, have made him a hated figure in the West, where public opinion holds bin Laden to be a reviled figurehead of mass murder.
Osama bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as "Osama bin Laden". The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other US governmental agencies, have used either "Usama bin Laden" or the accepted transliteration "Usama bin Ladin".
Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means "Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden".[1] "Mohammed" refers to Bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; "Awad" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman; "Laden" therefore refers to Bin Laden's great-great-grandfather, Laden Ali al-Qahtani.[6]
He was named Usama, meaning "lion", after Usama ibn Zayd, one of the companions of Muhammad.[7] Osama bin Laden had assumed the kunya (teknonym) Abū ʿAbdallāh, meaning "father of Abdallah" The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as "Osama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "Bin Laden" alone, as "Bin Laden" is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to one of his sons Omar, the family's hereditary surname is āl-Qaḥṭānī, but Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, never officially registered the name.[8]
Osama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.[9][10] His father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden,[11][12] was a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family,[13] and Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem).[14][15] In a 1998 interview, Bin Laden gave his birth date as 10 March 1957.[citation needed] Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents.[16]
Mohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s.[17] The couple had four children, and Bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister.[14] The Bin Laden family made $5 billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around $25–30 million.[18]
Bin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim.[19] From 1968 to 1976, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School.[14][20] He studied economics and business administration[21] at King Abdulaziz University. Some reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979,[22] or a degree in public administration in 1981.[23] Bin Laden attended an English-language course in Oxford, England, during 1971.[24] One source described him as "hard working";[25] another said he left university during his third year without completing a college degree.[26]
At university, Bin Laden's main interest was religion, where he was involved in both "interpreting the Quran and jihad" and charitable work.[27] Other interests included writing poetry;[28] reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at centre forward and followed the English club Arsenal.[29] During his studies in Jeddah, Bin Laden became a pupil of the influential Islamist scholar Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and avidly read his treatises. He also read the writings of several Muslim Brotherhood leaders and was highly influenced by the Islamic revolutionary ideas advocated by Sayyid Qutb.[30]
At age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria;[31] but they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, 2 days before the 9/11 attacks.[32] Bin Laden's other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony.[33] Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives.[34][35] Many of Bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and as of 2010[update], Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements.[36]
Nasser al-Bahri, who was Bin Laden's personal bodyguard from 1997 to 2001, details Bin Laden's personal life in his memoir. He describes him as a frugal man and strict father, who enjoyed taking his large family on shooting trips and picnics in the desert.[37]
Bin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington[38] misjudged a landing.[39] Bin Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem bin Laden, the subsequent head of the Bin Laden family, was killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, when he accidentally flew a plane into power lines.[40]
The FBI described Bin Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in) and 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) in height and weighing about 73 kilograms (160 lb), although the author Lawrence Wright, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on al-Qaeda, The Looming Tower, writes that a number of Bin Laden's close friends confirmed that reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that Bin Laden was actually "just over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall".[41] Eventually, after his death, he was measured to be roughly 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in).[42] Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. Bin Laden had stopped wearing the traditional Saudi male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh.[43] Bin Laden was described as soft-spoken and mild-mannered in demeanor.[44]
According to former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer, who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that US foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East.[45] As such, the threat to US national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what the US is but rather by what the US does, o

Personal detailsBorn (1961-08-26) 26 August 1961 (age 62)Ipswich, Queensland, Australia[1]Political partyAustralian Labor PartyChildrenJacqueline NeumannResidenceFlinders ViewAlma materUniversity of Queensland[1]ProfessionLawyer[1]Websitewww.shayneneumann.com.au
Shayne Kenneth Neumann (born 26 August 1961) is an Australian politician. He was elected to the Federal seat of Blair in November 2007, and re-elected in 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2022. In March 2013, Shayne was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing. After the 2013 Federal election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and for Ageing. In 2016, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. After the 2019 Federal election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel.
Early life
Neumann was born in Ipswich, Queensland.[2] Neither of his parents completed high school; his father was a meatworker and his mother was a shop assistant. In his maiden speech, he stated: "In my childhood, I was exposed to the twin evils of addiction to alcohol and gambling. I lived through the poverty caused thereby and the pain of the divorce which followed."[3]
Neumann attended Ipswich East State Primary School and Bundamba State Secondary College. His first job was as a cleaner at a meatworks in Dinmore.[3] He completed a Bachelors of Arts majoring in government and economics, and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Queensland.[2] Shayne was a partner in the Brisbane-based law firm of Neumann and Turnour Lawyers, which he established at the age of 26 in partnership with Matthew Turnour (brother of former Federal MP Jim Turnour). He specialised in family law.[3]
Political career
Neumann has cited the rise of Pauline Hanson in his home town of Ipswich as his motivation for becoming more involved in politics.[4]
Neumann was the Labor candidate for Blair at the 2004 federal election, and was heavily defeated by sitting Liberal member Cameron Thompson who received 61.21 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. Blair was considered a Liberal safe seat at the time.[5]
Neumann sought a rematch in 2007. This time, he was aided by two factors. Firstly, a redistribution of the electoral boundaries, finalised in 2006, pushed Blair further into Ipswich while cutting out the conservative-leaning rural towns of Esk and Kingaroy, roughly halving Thompson's majority and putting Blair just outside the range of seats that Labor would have needed to win government.[6] Secondly, there was a big Labor resurgence across the country at the 2007 federal election under the leadership of Kevin Rudd. This resurgence was at its greatest in Rudd's home state of Queensland.[7] Neumann won the seat on a swing of 10.17 points.
Neumann was re-elected in 2010 with only a modest swing against him.  He was re-elected in 2013, actually picking up a small swing in his favour as Labor lost government.  In 2016, Neumann technically made Blair a safe Labor seat by taking 58.88 percent of the two-party vote.[8]
Neumann supported Rudd in the Australian Labor Party leadership spill on 26 June 2013.[9] He stated that "it was a really tough decision because I thought it was in the best interests of our state and of the people in my electorate."[9] In Labor's October 2013 leadership spill, Neumann supported Bill Shorten.[10]
Following the ALP's defeat at the 2013 federal election, Neumann served as a shadow minister under opposition leaders Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese, including as a member of Shorten's shadow cabinet from 2013 to 2019. He held the shadow portfolios of Indigenous affairs (2013–2016), ageing (2013–2016), Northern Australia (2016), immigration and border protection (2016–2019), and veterans' affairs and defence personnel (2019–2022). However, he was not included in the Albanese ministry after the ALP won the 2022 election.[2]
Political positions
Neumann is a Christian.[11] He has been described as part of the Labor Right,[12] [13] and as such he was opposed to same sex marriage until late 2015.[13][14] Neumann had publicly stated his opposition to same sex marriage in August 2011,[15] August 2013,[16] and June 2015.[17] In December 2015, Neumann confirmed his newfound support of same sex marriage.[14] In August 2016, Neumann said he was against the proposed plebiscite on same sex marriage.[18]
Neumann has been against pushes to repeal Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.[19] He said the laws protect free speech, but also protect against racial hatred.[19]

Waruhiu Itote (1922 – 30 April 1993, aged 70-71), nom de guerre General China, was one of the key leaders of the Mau Mau Uprising (1952–1960) in British Kenya alongside Dedan Kimathi, Stanley Mathenge, Kurito ole Kisio, Musa Mwariama and Muthoni Kirima.
General China was the first senior Mau Mau leader to be captured by the government, when he fell into a trap in 1954. He was jailed alongside future Kenyan president Jomo Kenyatta.
Because of his cooperation with the colonial government, General China's legacy is often controversial. To most of his compatriots, he was a turn-coat who saved his neck by betraying others.[1] He is regarded one of the few moderates among the Mau Mau leadership[2]
Early life
Waruhiu Itote was born into a prosperous farming family in Kaheti village, Mukurwe-ini division, Nyeri District in 1922. He received minimal education at a local Church of Scotland mission, before moving to Nairobi as a teenager to escape his father's beatings.
Itote enlisted in the British army in 1942, serving in the King's African Rifles throughout Asia, firstly at Ceylon and then in the Burma Campaign.[3] Whilst in Burma he was promoted to the rank of Corporal. He passed up an opportunity for promotion and asked to be discharged
Returning to Kenya, he became disillusioned with the lack of opportunities for black soldiers while white soldiers were being rewarded, leading him to become involved in urban politics as he joined the Kenya African Union in 1946.[3] In the company of fellow ex-army comrades he dabbled in the criminal underworld as part of Nairobi's Forty Group, to supplement his wages as a fireman.[3]
Mau Mau Years
In 1950, Itote swore the Mau Mau oath, and subsequently became responsible for oathing and was an executioner of traitors.[3] As the police began clamping down on Mau Mau activities in 1952, Itote moved to the forests of Mount Kenya with a band of followers to join the insurgency. From here Itote began a wave of attacks on white settler farms in Nyeri and targeted loyalists in nearby villages. He soon gained a reputation as a skilled commander with an ability to organise.[4]
Capture
Itote was captured by British troops on 15 January 1954 during a failed operation against a police post in Mathira.[5] During the capture, he was shot and wounded in the neck.[6]
He was charged with consorting with persons carrying firearms and being in possession of ammunition. Itote was represented at his trial by the prominent Asian lawyer A.R. Kapila.[7] Itote was found guilty and sentenced to hang.
Negotiations to end the War
Following a deal instigated by Ian Henderson, Itote agreed to cooperate with the government and negotiate an end to the uprising in return for his life. The cooperation of Itote helped General Erskine bring Operation Anvil to a close.[2]
Detention and later life
Itote was placed in a detention camp in Lokitaung. Here he stayed with his former opponent, Jomo Kenyatta who taught him how to speak and write in English.[8]
In prison, General China saved the future president's life after a fellow inmate, Kariuki Chotara, then a minor on murder charges, attempted to stab Jomo Kenyatta.[9]
Itote stayed in detention for the next nine years, and was released in 1962. He was then taken under the wing of Kenyatta in his new government. He also got military training in Israel, before returning to Kenya to serve as assistant director of the National Youth Service under Geoffrey Griffin, a position he held up to 1984.
In 1967 he published his autobiography, "Mau Mau" General (East African Publishing House), and in 1979 wrote Mau Mau in Action (Transafrica Books). He served as the top officer of Kenya National Youth service with his headquarters at Ruaraka, Nairobi.
He died of a stroke in 1993 at the age of 71. At the time of his death he was running a farm near Ol Kalou in Kenya.
Legacy
In 2010, Waruhiu's wife and stepdaughter donated the bullet that had been lodged in his neck for three decades to the National Museums of Kenya.[5] The bullet was removed in 1988; it had gone through his chin, bruised his collarbone, ricocheted to the left and then lodged itself at the base of his neck.

<s> Garrincha playing for Brazil at the 1962 FIFA World CupPersonal informationFull name
Manuel Francisco dos Santos (28 October 1933 – 20 January 1983), nicknamed Mané Garrincha, best known as simply Garrincha (Portuguese pronunciation: [ɡaˈʁĩʃɐ], "little bird"),[3] was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a right winger. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and by many, one of the greatest dribblers ever.[4][5]
Garrincha played a vital role in Brazil's 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories. In 1962, when Pelé got injured, Garrincha led Brazil to a World Cup victory with a dominating performance throughout the tournament. He also became the first player to win the Golden Ball (Player of the tournament), Golden Boot (Leading Goalscorer) and the World Cup in the same tournament. He was also named in the World Cup All-Star Teams of both 1958 World Cup and 1962 World Cup. In 1994, he was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Garrincha and Pelé.[6] In 1999, he came seventh in the FIFA Player of the Century grand jury vote.[7] He is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century, and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Hall of Fame.[8] Due to his immense popularity in Brazil, he was also called Alegria do Povo (People's Joy) and Anjo de Pernas Tortas (Bent-Legged Angel).[9]
At club level, Garrincha played the majority of his professional career for the Brazilian team Botafogo. In the Maracanã Stadium, the home team room is known as "Garrincha".[10] In the capital Brasília, the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha is named after him. He is credited for inspiring the first bullfighting chants of olé to be used at football grounds.[11]
Early life
Garrincha was born in Pau Grande, a district of Magé, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 1933. He was born with his right leg 6 centimetres shorter than his left, also his left leg turned outwards and his right turned inwards, leading one doctor to certify him as crippled as a child.[12][13]
His father was an alcoholic, drinking cachaça heavily, a problem which Garrincha would inherit.[9] A boy with a carefree attitude, he was smaller than other kids his age, with his sister Rosa noticing he was as small as a little bird she started calling him Garrincha, the north-eastern name for the wren, a little brown bird.[14] The name stuck and by the age of four years he was known as Garrincha to his family and friends.[14] Garrincha was also known as Mané (short for Manuel) by his friends.[15] The combined Mané Garrincha is common among fans in Brazil.[citation needed]
Garrincha was known amongst footballing scouts but did not arrive in professional football until his late teens; he had no interest in a professional career despite his immense talent.[16]
Garrincha's younger brother, Jimmy dos Santos, played 20 games for Série A side CR Vasco da Gama in 1959.[citation needed]
Club career
Garrincha playing for Botafogo in a 2–0 win against Barcelona for Copa Iberoamericana, friendly tournament in 1964 at Buenos Aires.
Garrincha was already married and a parent when he signed for Botafogo in 1953. Team officials were ecstatic to learn that he was over 18 and able to be treated as a professional. In his first training session, he demonstrated his extraordinary skills by dribbling the ball through the legs of Nílton Santos, a Brazilian international defender and defensive midfielder who had 16 international caps. Santos was so impressed with the young Garrincha, he asked that Botafogo sign him.[17] He played in a 5–0 win for Botafogo's reserves and then scored a hat trick on his first-team début against Bonsucesso on 19 July 1953.[citation needed]
Garrincha continued to play brilliantly, but Brazil had other talented players in his position, notably Julinho and together with a new European style of play centered on teamwork, he was not named in the squad for the 1954 World Cup. He helped Botafogo win the Campeonato Carioca in 1957 by scoring 20 goals in 26 games finishing second in the league scoring charts and this convinced the national team selectors to name him to the 1958 World Cup squad. After the 1962 World Cup, Garrincha returned to Rio and carried Botafogo to victory in the 1962 Campeonato Carioca final against Flamengo.[17] Garrincha played for Botafogo for 12 years, the bulk of his professional career. He won the Campeonato Carioca three times with them, scored 232 goals in 581 matches, and became a symbol of the history of the club.[citation needed]
In 1966, with his career declining, he was sold to Corinthians. Two years later, he signed for Colombian team Atlético Junior. The same year he went back to Brazil and joined Flamengo, where he would stay until 1969. In 1971, there were rumours that Garrincha, 38, would join French club Red Star, but he never signed and stayed in Brazil.[18]
An entertainer renowned for his dribbling skills in taking on opposing players, Garrincha inspiring the first bullfighting chants of olé to be used at football grounds; during a 1958 club game for Botafogo he gave a footballing lesson to River Plate defender Vairo, constantly teasing, feinting and going past him to ole's from the crowd, and when he "forgot" the ball and sprinted away with Vairo running after him the chants of olés changed to laughter.[11] Garrincha's professional career as a footballer lasted until 1972, when he played for Olaria, but he played occasional exhibition matches until 1982.[19]
Garrincha was subject to numerous transfer attempts by rich European clubs like Juventus of Turin, Italy who tried to sign him in 1954. Real Madrid of Spain tried to sign him in 1959 after some stunning performances by him on a tour of Europe. Internazionale, AC Milan and Juventus of Italy considered jointly signing him in 1963 (he would have to spend a season with each); a deal that would have been unique in football.[citation needed]
International career
Garrincha played 50 international matches for Brazil between 1955 and 1966, and was a starter for the national team in the 1958, 1962 and 1966 World Cups. Brazil lost only one match with him on the pitch, against Hungary at the 1966 World Cup. This was the last time Garrincha played in National team. Pelé did not play the game against Hungary, and thus Brazil never lost when Garrincha and Pelé were in the same lineup.[citation needed]
His first cap was against Chile in Rio de Janeiro in 1955. He played two matches at the Copa América of 1957 and four in the 1959 edition, Brazil finished runners up in both editions.[citation needed]
1958 World Cup
On 29 May, ten days before the 1958 World Cup finals started, Garrincha scored one of his most famous goals, against Fiorentina in Italy. He beat four defenders and the goalkeeper, before stopping on the goal line. Rather than kicking the ball into the open goal, he then dribbled past the returning Enzo Robotti to score.[20][21] Despite his stunning performance his coaches were upset at what they considered an irresponsible move and this likely led to Garrincha not being picked for Brazil's first two matches of the 1958 tournament.[22] However, he did start their third match against the USSR; this match marked the debut of both Garrincha and Pelé (although Garrincha was seven years older than Pele, both being born in October, respectively in 1933 and in 1940). The Soviets were one of the favourites for the tournament, and the Brazilians had been nervous about playing them.[15]  Their manager, Vicente Feola, decided to attack directly from the kickoff. Garrincha received the ball on the right wing, beat three opposing players and took a shot which hit the post. With the match still less than a minute old, he set up a chance for Pelé, who hit the crossbar,[15] and continually caused problems for the Soviet defence. Brazil were so impressive in the opening moments that the game's start is often referred to as "the best three minutes of football of all time".[23]  Brazil won the match 2–0.[citation needed]
"Garrincha was more of a danger than Pelé I believe at the time, a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic."
Following the Brazilians' narrow 1–0 quarter-final win against Wales on 19 June 1958, Mel Hopkins (the fullback who faced him that game) described Garrincha as "a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic. It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too."[9]
In the final against Sweden, Brazil fell behind 0–1 early, but rapidly equalized after Garrincha went past his marker on the right wing and sent a cross for Vavá to score. Before the end of the first half, Garrincha made a similar play, again setting up Vavá to make the score 2–1. Brazil ended winning the match and its first World Cup trophy, with Garrincha being one of the best players of the tournament; he was voted to the "Best XI" for the competition.[citation needed]
Garrincha never bothered about the 'details' of the game. As his teammates were celebrating the World Cup win, he was initially bemused, having been under the impression that the competition was more league-like and that Brazil would play all the other teams twice.[24]
1958–1962
Garrincha put on weight after the World Cup, partly because of his drinking,[25] so he was dropped from the national team for a friendly match in Rio against England on 13 May 1959. Later that month, he went on tour with Botafogo in Sweden and got a local girl pregnant.[26] When he returned to Brazil, he drove home to Pau Grande and ran over his father, Amaro. He drove off without stopping, with an angry mob chasing him, and when they caught up with him they found him "drunk, almost catatonic, and with no grasp of what he had done."[27] In August, his wife, Nair, gave birth to their fifth child, and his mistress Iraci announced her first pregnancy. His father died of liver cancer on 10 October having been dependent on alcohol for years.[28]
1962 World Cup
Garrincha was the most outstanding player of the 1962 FIFA World Cup. When Pelé suffered an injury after the second match and was sidelined for the rest of the tournament, Garrincha played a leading role in Brazil's triumph, excelling particularly against England and Chile, scoring 4 goals in those two matches.[citation needed]
After one win and one draw, Brazil faced Spain, without Pelé. The South Americans were losing 0–1 in the second half. Amarildo, Pelé's substitute for the remainder of the tournament, scored the equalizer. Five minutes before the end, Garrincha took the ball on the right flank, dribbled past a defender and paused. Then he dribbled past the same man and another defender,[29] and sent a cross to Amarildo, who scored again to win the match.[citation needed]
In the quarter-finals against England, Garrincha opened the score with a header off a corner kick. England equalized before half time. I

Timothy Andrew Fischer AC FTSE (3 May 1946 – 22 August 2019) was an Australian politician and diplomat who served as leader of the National Party from 1990 to 1999. He was the tenth deputy prime minister in the Howard government from 1996 to 1999.
Fischer was born in Lockhart, New South Wales. He served with the Australian Army in the Vietnam War. On his return he bought a farming property at Boree Creek. He served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1984. Fischer was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1984 election, representing the Division of Farrer until his retirement in 2001. He replaced Charles Blunt as leader of the National Party in 1990, and in the Howard government served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. After leaving politics, Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2007, and was later Ambassador to the Holy See from 2009 to 2012.
Early life
Fischer was born on 3 May 1946 in Lockhart, New South Wales.[1][2] He was the fourth of five children born to Barbara Mary (née van Cooth) and Julius Ralph Fischer; he was predeceased by an older brother who died of meningitis as an infant.[3] His parents were "from once wealthy Melbourne families whose businesses had collapsed with the onset of the Great Depression".[4] Fischer's father worked as a jackaroo, settling in Boree Creek, New South Wales, in 1936, where he ran a stock and station agency and later bought a small farm.[5] His paternal grandfather was born in Kleve, Germany, and had his assets frozen due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. His paternal grandmother was the daughter of a French seaman.[6] Fischer's mother worked as a nurse prior to her marriage. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch immigrant who married the daughter of Francis Mason, an Irish immigrant who became speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.[4]
Fischer grew up on the family property at Boree Creek and attended Boree Creek Public School for six years. From 1958 he boarded at Xavier College in Melbourne.[7] He graduated in 1963 and won a scholarship to attend university, but returned to Boree Creek to assist his family.[8] In 1966 he was conscripted into the Australian Army and commissioned at the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville. Fischer served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) between July 1966 and March 1969 as a second lieutenant.[9] With his battalion, he served in the Vietnam War.[10] Fischer was wounded in the Battle of Coral-Balmoral in May–June 1968.[11] 1RAR and the 1st Australian Task Force were awarded Unit Citation for Gallantry for their actions Battle of Coral-Balmoral and Fischer was entitled to wear the citation insignia.[12]
Upon his return from Vietnam, Fischer took over the family property at Boree Creek and became active in the Country Party, as the party was then called.[13]
Career
State politics
Fischer represented Sturt in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1971 to 1980 and Murray from 1980 to 1984. He served on the opposition frontbench from 1978 to 1984.[1]
Federal politics
In 1984, Fischer won the federal seat of Farrer in the New South Wales far west for the National Party of Australia, as the Country Party had been renamed.[14] Within a year he was on the opposition frontbench, and soon became a popular figure in both the party and parliament. His sometimes rustic manner and bumbling English concealed a shrewd political brain. In 1990, when an attempt by Charles Blunt to modernise the Nationals' image ended with him losing his own seat, Fischer succeeded him as leader, defeating the former leader Ian Sinclair.[15][16]
Fischer was an enthusiastic supporter of the "Fightback" package of economic and tax reforms proposed by the Liberal leader John Hewson in 1991. But he was unsuccessful in persuading the majority of rural voters, particularly in Queensland, that the proposed changes, particularly the goods and services tax, were in their interests, and Labor under Paul Keating won the 1993 election. On 23 March 1993, ten days after the election, Ian Sinclair unsuccessfully challenged Fischer for the leadership.[17]
In January 1994, Fischer suffered head and neck injuries in a car accident 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south of his property in Lockhart, New South Wales. His car T-boned a vehicle that had failed to yield to a give-way sign; the driver and passenger in the other vehicle were killed. Fischer was knocked unconscious in the accident and taken to hospital in Wagga Wagga.[18] He took a month off from politics to aid his recovery, with his deputy John Anderson acting as party leader in his absence.[19]
The Liberals finally regained office under John Howard in 1996. Fischer became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The Liberals had won a majority in their own right in the 1996 election, leaving the Nationals in a much weaker position compared to previous Coalition governments. Nonetheless, Fischer was fairly active. He supported the government introducing tough gun control measures on automatic and semi-automatic weapons following the Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 alongside then-prime minister John Howard, measures which were opposed by much of his party's rural base.[15][20]
Fischer also had difficulty with the determination of many Liberals, including the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to carry out sweeping free-market reforms, including abolishing tariff protection for rural industries, deregulating petrol prices and implementing other measures which farmers' organisations regarded as harmful to themselves.
In pushing to permanently extinguish native title rights of indigenous Australians following the Mabo and Wik decisions, Fischer attracted much criticism.[15]
Further trouble for Fischer and the Nationals came with the rise of One Nation, a right-wing populist party led by Pauline Hanson, a disendorsed Liberal candidate who was nonetheless elected member for the Queensland seat of Oxley at the 1996 federal election. One Nation had its greatest appeal in country areas of New South Wales and Queensland—the Nationals' traditional heartland. For much of 1997 and 1998, it looked as though One Nation might sweep the Nationals out of existence. In the 1998 election campaign, however, Fischer strongly counter-attacked One Nation, mainly on the grounds of their "flat tax" economic policies, and succeeded in holding the Nationals' losses to one Senate seat in Queensland.[21]
In 2001, shortly before the expiry of his last parliamentary term, Fischer made public his support for an Australian republic in the future.[22]
As an MP, and later as leader of the Nationals, Fischer often had a rather hectic schedule of visits to various rural National branch meetings, and other relevant functions and gatherings. As a result, he earned the affectionate nickname of "Two-Minute Tim" – often he would arrive, speak to the gathering for a few minutes (i.e. the "Two-Minutes"), grab a quick bite to eat while chatting to some of the attendees, then have to head off to the next stop on his schedule.[23]
In 2014 it was revealed on the ABC program A Country Road that sometime before the 1998 federal election, Fischer, then National Party leader, had met with his deputy John Anderson and former minister John Sharp for a luncheon at which they were surprised to learn from each other that they all intended to retire at the forthcoming election. They agreed that it was not a good idea for all of them to retire at the same time, as it could give a negative image to the party which at the time was battling against perceptions that its future was uncertain. In the end, only Sharp retired, with Fischer and Anderson delaying their own retirements and successfully recontesting the election.[24]
In 1999, he surprised his colleagues by resigning as party leader and as a minister, and by announcing that he would retire at the election due in 2001. His decision to quit politics was motivated partly by the demands of his family, in particular that his son Harrison has autism (Fischer himself claimed to have "high functioning" autism, though he was never professionally diagnosed).[25]
Fischer is the only person to have served the entirety of his ministerial career as Deputy Prime Minister.
Post-political career
After his retirement, he returned to farming at Boree Creek, and became involved in charity work, assisting organisations such as the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Fred Hollows Foundation and Autism New South Wales.[15]
Fischer served as chairman of Tourism Australia from 2004 until 2007. He was made a fellow (FTSE) of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) in 2000.[26] He served as chairman and a patron of the Crawford Fund, an initiative of the ATSE supporting international agricultural research, from 2001 to 2006. He was vice-chair and chair of the Crop Trust (2013–2017) and a "vigorous supporter" of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.[27] He served as national chairman of the Royal Flying Doctor Service.[28] He also served as founding Patron of Australia for UNHCR (2001–2006),[29] an Australian charity that raises funds for the UN's refugee agency.
Fischer was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2005 Australia Day Honours' List in recognition of his contributions to Australian politics, trade liberalisation, rail transport development, support of humanitarian aid, and to fostering community acceptance of cultural difference

Mitzi Gaynor (born Francesca Marlene de Czanyi von Gerber; September 4, 1931) is an American actress, singer, and dancer. Her notable films include We're Not Married! (1952), There's No Business Like Show Business (1954), The Birds and the Bees (1956), and South Pacific (1958) – for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical at the 1959 awards.
Early life
Mitzi Gaynor was born as Francesca Marlene de Czanyi von Gerber in Chicago to Henry de Czanyi von Gerber, a violinist, cellist, and music director of Hungarian descent, and his wife Pauline, a dancer.[2][3][4][5]
By her father's second marriage, she became stepsister to anti-war activist Donald W. Duncan.[6] The family first moved to Elgin, Illinois,[7] and then to Detroit, and later when she was age 11, to Hollywood. She trained as a ballerina as a child and began her career in the corps de ballet. At 13, she was singing and dancing with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera company. She lied about her address so she could attend Le Conte Junior High in Hollywood.
Career
20th Century Fox
Gaynor signed a seven-year contract with Twentieth Century-Fox at age 17. She sang, acted, and danced in a number of film musicals, often paired with some of the male musical stars of the day. A Fox Studio executive thought that Mitzi Gerber sounded like the name of a delicatessen, and they came up with a name that used the same initials.[3]
Gaynor made her film debut in the musical My Blue Heaven (1950); Betty Grable and Dan Dailey starred and she had a supporting role. A college drama Take Care of My Little Girl (1951) followed, with Gaynor's playing the roommate of Jeanne Crain.
Stardom
Fox then gave Gaynor a star part, in the musical biopic Golden Girl (1951), playing Lotta Crabtree. It was a mild success at the box office.[8] Gaynor was one of several stars in the anthology comedy We're Not Married! (1952), and then she was top billed in the musical Bloodhounds of Broadway (1952), which made $2 million (equivalent to $22.04 million in 2022).[9]
Fox put her in The I Don't Care Girl (1952) as Eva Tanguay. The film made $1.25 million.[10] Gaynor starred in Down Among the Sheltering Palms (1953), playing a South Sea island girl. She was the female lead in Three Young Texans (1954). Gaynor's most popular film in her time at Fox was Irving Berlin's There's No Business Like Show Business (1954). She was billed after Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor, and Johnnie Ray.
Jack Bean
Gaynor married Jack Bean, a talent agent and public relations executive for MCA, in San Francisco on November 18, 1954. Their home was on North Arden Drive in Beverly Hills, California.[11] She had just been released from Twentieth Century-Fox (before the start of There's No Business Like Show Business) with four years left on her contract and decided with the time off to get married. The union was childless. After their marriage, Bean quit MCA, started his publicity firm named Bean & Rose, and managed Gaynor's career.[3][12][13][14]
Paramount
In 1956, Gaynor appeared in the Paramount remake of Anything Goes, co-starring Bing Crosby, Donald O'Connor, and Zizi Jeanmaire, loosely based on the musical by Cole Porter, P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. Paramount cast her in The Birds and the Bees (1956), playing the role originated by Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve (1941). Her third film for Paramount was The Joker Is Wild (1957), a biopic of Joe E. Lewis starring Frank Sinatra, in which Gaynor played the female lead. In 1957, Gaynor appeared in MGM's Les Girls, directed by George Cukor, with Gene Kelly and Kay Kendall.
South Pacific
Her biggest international fame came from her starring role as Ensign Nellie Forbush in the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific. For her performance, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical at the 1959 awards.
Gaynor followed this movie with Happy Anniversary (1959) with David Niven and the United Kingdom production Surprise Package (1960), a musical comedy thriller directed by Stanley Donen. Her co-stars were Yul Brynner and Noël Coward. The film's theme song was composed by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, music and lyrics, respectively. Dancing and singing in a duet with Noël Coward, Gaynor performed this song in the film. [15][16] Her latest film role was For Love or Money (1963), starring Kirk Douglas.
Later career
Following her film work, Gaynor performed in other media. She appeared between two sets by The Beatles when they made their second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 16, 1964. She performed for a nine-minute segment from the stage of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach, separated by one commercial break. She sang "Too Darn Hot" and a blues medley. At the 1967 Academy Awards ceremony, she sang the theme from the film Georgy Girl. Gaynor later added the number to her concert repertoire. Through the 1960s and 1970s, she starred in nine television specials that garnered 16 Emmy nominations.
During her nightclub years, Gaynor developed and rehearsed her routines at The Cave, a club in Vancouver. She became fond of the city and frequently made guest appearances on local television for interviews. "Mitzi's back in town" became an annual slogan when Gaynor would come to the city for a number of weeks each year to develop her Las Vegas routines.
Gaynor recorded two albums for the Verve Records label, one called Mitzi and the second called Mitzi Gaynor Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin. She is thought to have earned more from the record royalties on the South Pacific soundtrack album than her salary for the movie. She also recorded the title song from her film Happy Anniversary for the Top Rank label. For several decades, Gaynor appeared regularly in Las Vegas and at nightclub and concert venues throughout the United States and Canada.[citation needed]
On December 4, 2006, Jack Bean, Gaynor's husband of 52 years, died of pneumonia in the couple's home, aged 84.[citation needed]
On July 30, 2008, Gaynor – along with Kenny Ortega, Elizabeth Berkley, Shirley MacLaine, and the cast members from High School Musical, So You Think You Can Dance, Dancing with the Stars, and other performers – appeared on the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences TV Moves Live, a celebration of 60 years of dance on television. Gaynor appeared performing the final few bars of "Poor Papa", a song-and-dance number from her 1969 TV special, Mitzi's 2nd Special. Four months later, on November 18, 2008, City Lights Pictures released Mitzi Gaynor Razzle Dazzle: The Special Years, a documentary celebrating Gaynor's annual television specials of the 1960s and 1970s. The film, which was broadcast on public television and released on DVD, includes moments from the original specials (digitally remastered in 5.1 stereo) along with newly taped interviews with Gaynor colleagues, friends, and admirers, including Bob Mackie, Carl Reiner, Kristin Chenoweth, Rex Reed, Tony Charmoli, Alton Ruff, Randy Doney, and Kelli O'Hara. Gaynor's one-woman show Razzle Dazzle: My Life Behind the Sequins toured the United States and Vancouver from 2009 thru 2014, including a two-week engagement in New York City.
Honors
On October 14, 2006, the NY Alumni "adopted" Gaynor as an official "New Yorker" at Beverly Hills High School. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a proclamation paying tribute to her distinguished career as a singer, dancer, actress and writer.[17]
On April 10, 2007, she was honored by the Museum of Television & Radio in Los Angeles with a special evening celebrating her television specials of the 1960s–1970s. The sold-out event Mitzi Gaynor Razzle-Dazzle!: The Special Years featured a screening followed by a panel discussion with Gaynor, designer Bob Mackie and director-choreographer Tony Charmoli. In conjunction with the event, the museum also featured the month-long gallery exhibit Mitzi by Mackie, featuring Bob Mackie's Emmy-winning costumes from her specials along with a selection of costumes from Gaynor's legendary stage shows and concert appearances.

Television specials
On October 14, 1968, Gaynor starred in Mitzi, her first television special. In specials including Mitzi – The First Time and Mitzi ... Zings into Spring she showcased the talents she had first used as a theatrical performer, then in films like There's No Business Like Show Business, Les Girls, and South Pacific, and finally as a concert performer.

Ben Lummis (born Isileli Junior Brown on (1 June 1978) is a New Zealand R&B/Pop/Gospel recording artist who rose to musical fame as the winner of the First season of New Zealand Idol in 2004. He is of Māori (Ngati Porou) and Pākehā (European), Tongan & Samoan descent. He is very close to his family, and has five siblings
Biography
New Zealand Idol 2004
Lummis auditioned for the first season of New Zealand Idol in early 2004, and after passing through the theatre rounds, he qualified for the semi-finals, where the public voted him through to the Top 10. Lummis's first few weeks in the Top 10 were shaky, as he landed in the bottom 3 contestants on three separate occasions. However, from the top 6 onwards, he was never in the bottom three again, and on 10 May 2004, he was crowned as the first New Zealand Idol, defeating Michael Murphy, who had never been in the bottom three throughout the entire competition.  Ben is one of only two Idol winners worldwide to land in the Bottom 3 in the first week of their season's finals.  The other is 2005 Canadian Idol Melissa O'Neil.
Post Idol Career
2004–2005: One Road
Immediately after his victory, Lummis signed a recording contract with music giant Sony BMG and released his debut single "They Can't Take That Away", which debuted at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It held the position for seven weeks and was certified 4xPlatinum, selling 40,000 copies. Lummis completed a nationwide New Zealand Idol Live! tour with his fellow finalists, and then on 15 June 2004, just four weeks after his Idol victory, Lummis released his debut album, One Road. The album sold 45,000 copies[2] and was certified 3xPlatinum.  Paul Ellis, Ben's manager at the time and  New Zealand Idol judge later described it as " worst-sounding album of my entire career" due to the short timeframe it was produced.[3]
Three months after the release of his album, Lummis suddenly left his record label Sony BMG under mutual disagreement.[4] Many music industry observers stated that the move was interesting, as Lummis had held the top spot on the albums and singles chart simultaneously for more than a week with strong sales, but was dropped by his label nevertheless.
2006–2007: Independent Music and Pop's Ultimate Star
Having taken a career break following his debut album and departure from Sony BMG, Lummis released the single "Gotta Move" in 2006, independently and exclusively through his personal website. Although well received by fans, the single was unable to chart as its sales were online only and at the time, not tracked by the RIANZ.
After another short break, Lummis was announced as one of the ten contestants on Pop's Ultimate Star, a new New Zealand reality television show whose aim was to take contestants from past singing competitions and pit them against one another to discover the country's favourite reality show singing star. The show debuted on 29 May 2007, and after passing through the first four weeks without falling into the bottom two at all, Lummis made it to the final six. At this point he fell into the bottom two alongside Emily Williams, the runner-up from the third season of Australian Idol, and was voted off on 1 July after an elimination duel with Williams, finishing in sixth place. After this, he announced his intention to release more new music independently.[5]
2007–present: New Album
Lummis announced in late 2007, that he had intentions on writing more of his own music, and releasing songs independently on a new album. Since then Lummis has been working on a new album, right throughout 2008.
He has also appeared on the TVNZ morning show, Good Morning, where he made a live performance of one of his new tracks called, "Smooth Lady", the first song from the album. However, this album has not been released as of 2021.

Gonzalo Fonseca (2 July 1922 – 11 June 1997) was a Uruguayan artist known for his stone sculpting.  He originally studied to be an architect at the University of Montevideo, but discovered modern art in 1942 after working in the Taller Torres-Garcia workshop.  He studied painting in the workshop until 1949, and became interested in pre-Columbian art during that time. Fonseca is frequently associated with the movement Universal Constructivism.
Biography
Fonseca was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in July 1922. He traveled to Europe in the 1930s, and was exposed to archaeology, anthropology, and history. Fonseca also taught himself to sculpt in stone and paint with watercolor. In 1939, he began studying architecture at the University of Montevideo. However, in 1942 Fonseca left the University to work with Joaquín Torres-García. While working at the Torres-Garcia workshop, he became more diverse in his techniques, trying sculpting, painting, ceramics, and drawing. During the course of the 1940s, Fonseca traveled through Peru and Bolivia, studying art with other members of the Torres-Garcia workshop.[1]
In 1950 he left Uruguay, and traveled through several countries in Europe and the Middle East.[1] Fonseca worked in excavations run by Flinders Petrie in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and traveled through Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. These archeological digs would prove fundamental in his future artworks.[2] While living in Europe, he worked in ceramics as well as painting.[1]
He met and married Elizabeth Kaplan, from New York City, in the mid-1950s (and divorced two decades later) and moved to Manhattan in 1958 after being awarded a Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. He had four children, Quina, Bruno, Caio, and Isabel with Elizabeth Kaplan, two of whom (Bruno Fonseca and Caio Fonseca) became renowned artists.[3] Their youngest child Isabel Fonseca became a writer.
In 1962 Fonseca had his first exhibition in the United States, at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. This exhibition contained mostly flat compositions, as was common with the works done by the Torres-Garcia workshop at that time. Fonseca also created wooden reliefs for this exhibition, which laid a foundation for his three-dimensional art.[1] He began working in New York and in Italy, near Carrara. It is in the 1970s that he focuses on painting towards sculpture and on three-dimensional architectural forms.[1] He started working on large scale pieces mostly of marble, and recycled limestone from New York's demolished buildings.[3] In 1983, he became a citizen of the United States. During the late 1970s and 1980s he became more focused on towers, such as Torre del recien nacido ("Tower of the Newborn Child") and Torre de los vientos. He had few solo shows throughout his career, but several group exhibitions in which he became known for his stone sculptures of modern influenced architectural forms.[3]  He died in Italy at the age of 74 in Seravezza, Italy, in his studio.[3]
Iconology
As a Universal Constructivist, Fonseca sought to focus on art outside of nationality. This is clear in the amount of traveling and excavating he did, not trying to define a national identity but rather a universal identity, free of false stereotypes.
Fonseca's influence on his art derived from a fascination with history and cultures, and his early training as an architect helped him realize and formulate his sculptures.  His pieces offer a sense of mystery, and yet a deeper meaning.
Fonseca's sculptures take architectural reference as well as that of ancient ruins and what he studied while taking part in excavations.  This causes the viewer to recognize and identify parts of the sculpture, perhaps relating them to the characteristics of a building or home.  But the way in which he manifests these pieces still leaves something to be defined by the viewer in relation to time and space.  His works do not automatically construct a definite time period in the viewer's mind, leaving it to the imagination as to what it may or may not represent in time and space.[4]
Fonseca was very interested in the nature and history of the stones used in his sculpture. While working in the quarries, he would notice the changes in the stone due to climate. It is said that the fragile nature of many of these stones is why Fonseca had so few exhibitions: sand did not travel well.
Fonseca's sculpture has two clear features. The first is the intimacy that causes one to relate innately to his works. The other feature is the grandeur in his sculpture, strengthened by the simplicity of the geometric forms. His art is known as "a journey through the history of archeology." The archeological basis stems from Precolombian architecture as well as Eastern Mediterranean, and even New York City architecture. It was clear that archeology spread through all of Fonseca's work.
Fonseca's artworks also tend to be a labyrinth of thought. Some of the works contain inscriptions that may give a glimpse, but do not truly allow much insight into his mind. There are many stairways and ladders in his sculptures, which lead to tombs such as the quarries he worked in. Fonseca shared that these ladders also show the "descent into the infernos."[1][5]
Selected artworks
This sculpture was constructed as a tribute to the Greek architect Andronicus. Andronicus had built a tower in Athens to commemorate the gods of the winds. Fonseca's tribute had four sides, each side with Latin inscriptions indicating the four different kinds of winds in Greek mythology.  The four winds are the North wind known as Boreas, which brought hail; the East morning wind known as Eurus; the South wind known as Noto, which brought sorrow; and the mild wind from the West known as Zephirus, which was feared by the sailors. The dome on top likely symbolizes the center of the world, with its inscription Onphalos.[1]
This sculpture was precisely carved and was placed in three separate contexts: Seravezza, Italy, Pietrasanta, Italy, and the entrance of Uruguay's Pavilion at the XLIV Biennale Di Venezia.[5] It contains a ladder, which is common in Fonseca's work, which is known to relate to both the Hebrew ladder of Jacob and also the ladders in the quarries he excavated in.
This sculpture is known for its contrast in change of scale. There are multiple cuts into the wood filled with geometric forms, as well as his well-known stairways. This artwork also contains "betilos", known as sacred stones.[1]
This artwork was a relief painting with engravings of ladders and figures. It also included wood-carved objects hanging from the top corner of the painting.
This work was part of horizontal, heavy slabs that were displayed as urban projects for participants to interact with. It was carved of red travertine marble.  It mimics the form of an actual grain store, but also refers to a store of knowledge, with the grain representing the knowledge.
XIX Olympiad
Fonseca designed and created a 12-meter high concrete tower as his contribution to the Route of Friendship (Spanish: La Ruta de la Amistad) of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.  It was titled Torre.  This structure recalls the shape of the Malwiya, the spiral minaret of the Great Mosque of Samarra.  It is hollow, and was later converted into a studio, then used as an artists' exhibition space from 1997 to 2004.
The XIX Olympiad was significant in that these were the first Olympic Games held in Latin America. The "Route of Friendship" contained nineteen concrete sculptures on the highway surrounding the capital. This was a collaboration of architect Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and German sculptor Mathias Goeritz. The goal was to give a universal quality to the Games with sculptures from around the world.[6]
This structure is not to be confused with La Torre de los Vientos, or The Tower of the Winds, which was built in 1974 as a tribute.[1][7][8][6]

Michael Granville Valpy (born 1942) is a Canadian journalist and author. He wrote for The Globe and Mail[1] newspaper where he covered both political and human interest stories until leaving the newspaper in October, 2010. Through a long career at the Globe, he was a reporter, Toronto- and Ottawa-based national political columnist, member of the editorial board, deputy managing editor, and Africa-based correspondent during the last years of apartheid. He has also been a national political columnist for the Vancouver Sun. Since leaving the Globe he has been published by the newspaper on a freelance basis as well as by CBC News Online, the Toronto Star and the National Post.[2]
Life
Valpy was born in 1942[3] in Toronto and lived there until his family moved to Vancouver, where his mother's family was from, after World War II.[4] His great-grandfather, W. W. Walkem, was Vancouver's first European doctor and the brother of George Anthony Walkem, British Columbia's third premier. He has three children. He has been married and divorced twice, first with The Globe and Mail's former chief librarian, Amanda Ferguson, and second with lawyer Deborah Coyne.
Career
Valpy studied at the University of British Columbia towards a general arts degree for two years before dropping out of university after the premature death of his father and having no money to continue his studies. After considering entering the Anglican priesthood, Valpy went to work for the Vancouver Sun in 1961 as a reporter and was then night city editor at the short-lived Vancouver Times. In 1965, when the Times folded, he was hired by The Globe and Mail first as a reporter, then as a feature writer and member of the editorial board. In 1966 and 1967, Valpy was a staff member for the short-lived Company of Young Canadians. He returned to the Vancouver Sun, first as a member of its editorial board and then as a political columnist based in Ottawa, Ontario. 
On 13 December 1971, Valpy revealed in an article the secret deal brokered by Justice William Henderson to end the trial of the "Kingston 13".[5] During the 1971 Kingston Penitentiary riot, a group of inmates led by Brian Beaucage had tortured 16 men and killed 2 of them. In October 1971, the "Kingston 13" as the accused were known went on trial in Kingston. Valpy revealed that there had been a secret deal to end the trial as Justice Henderson had called several meetings with the defense lawyers and the Crown Attorneys to discuss how to arrange plea bargains to give the accused the lightest possible sentences with led to a sudden end to the trial on 22 November 1971.[6]
In 1981, he rejoined The Globe and Mail as a national affairs columnist and subsequently served as its Africa correspondent from 1984 to 1988 after which he returned to Canada to serve as the newspaper's urban affairs columnist, its deputy managing editor and, after running for Parliament for the NDP, as the paper's religion writer and feature writer.[4]
Valpy left The Globe and Mail in 2010. He is a senior fellow at Massey College at the University of Toronto, a fellow at the University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance and teaches in the university's book and media studies program. He was the 2011–2012 Canwest Global Fellow in Media at University of Western Ontario and was awarded the 2012–2013 Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy. He continues to write as a freelance journalist with pieces published on the CBC News website and the Toronto Star as well as The Globe and Mail.
Political views
Despite being from what he describes as a "strongly Tory monarchist British imperialist-quite right wing" family,[4] Valpy was one of the more left-leaning writers at the Globe. In the 2000 federal election, Valpy ran as a New Democratic Party candidate in the Toronto riding of Trinity—Spadina, against Liberal Party of Canada incumbent Tony Ianno. He was not elected.
Works
Valpy co-authored three books (two on Canada's Constitution and the third on the 21st-century generation of new Canadian adults), produced public affairs documentaries for CBC Radio, contributed chapters to several books on public policy issues and written for Maclean's, Time Canada, Policy Options, Shambhala Sun and Elm Street magazines.
Awards
He has won three National Newspaper Awards (two for foreign reporting and one for an analysis of dysfunctional students in the public education system) and been nominated for a fourth (for a profile of Michael Ignatieff), In 1997, he was awarded an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.) from Trent University.[7] He also received the Queen's Jubilee Medal in 2002.[8]

Toyoko Tokiwa (常盤 とよ子, Tokiwa Toyoko) (1928[1] – 24 December 2019[2]) was a Japanese photographer best known for her 1957 book of text and photographs Kiken na Adabana (危険な毒花), and particularly for its portrayal of the red-light district of post-occupation Yokohama, with US servicemen.[3]
Life and career
Toyoko Tokiwa (常盤 トヨ子) was born in Yokohama in 1928.[n 1] (As a photographer, she would later spell "toyo" in hiragana rather than the original katakana.[n 2]) Her family ran a liquor wholesaler at Kanagawa-dōri 4-chōme in Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama, where she lived until the building was burnt down in the American firebombing of 29 May 1945, an event in which her father sustained fatal burns.[4][5] Her elder brother had used a Rolleicord camera and a darkroom, and this combined with a desire to work among men led Tokiwa to want to work as a photographer, even before she had used a camera herself.[4]
Tokiwa graduated from Tokyo Kasei-Gakuin (the predecessor of Tokyo Kasei-Gakuin Junior College) in 1951.[3] She started work as an announcer but dreamt of being a photographer instead, joining the women-only Shirayuri Camera Club (白百合カメラクラブ, Shirayuri Kamera Kurabu);[6] she was influenced by the realism of Japanese photography at the time (led by Ken Domon).[3]
Some of Tokiwa's earliest photographs are of Ōsanbashi, the pier in Yokohama at which American ships docked and that was thus the site of emotional partings and reunions of American military families. She was able to photograph close up without attracting any comment, and greatly enjoyed the work.[4] But she quickly moved to her main interest, working women. Despite an initial hatred of the American military, prompted in particular by her father's death, and revulsion at prostitution, she simply invited herself into the akasen (red-light area) of Yokohama, asked the girls whether she might photograph, and was accepted.[5]
Tokiwa would later marry an amateur photographer, Taikō Okumura [Wikidata] (奥村泰宏, 1914–1995)[7][8] – whose photography of postwar Japan appears with hers in a 1996 book – and work as both housewife and photojournalist.[3]
She was a member of the Japan Professional Photographers Society[9] and chaired the Kanagawa Prefectural Photographers Association (神奈川県写真作家協会, Kanagawa-ken shashin-sakka kyōkai).[4][10]
Kiken na Adabana
Front cover of Tokiwa's 1957 book Kiken na Adabana. Tokiwa is holding a Canon rangefinder camera with Nikkor-P 8.5cm f/2 lens, superimposed on which is a detail of the final photograph within the book (p.226). The red obi, partly covering the black-and-white dust jacket, advertises 100 photographs.
In 1956 Tokiwa held an exhibition titled Hataraku Josei (働く女性, Working women) at the Konishiroku Photo Gallery (Tokyo) that won high acclaim. The exhibition showed pro wrestlers, models, ama, nurses and prostitutes.[3]
In 1957, her book Kiken na Adabana (危険な毒花, literally "Dangerous toxic/fruitless flowers"),[n 3] was published by Mikasa Shobō. Its text is divided into three parts:
Fāsutofurekkusu kara Kyanon made (i.e. "From Firstflex to Canon"; the Firstflex was a brand of twin-lens reflex camera made by Tokiwa Seiki, 常盤精機)
Each of these is further subdivided into short essays. The text is in the first person and often about Tokiwa herself: the (composite) cover photograph and the photograph in the frontispiece both show Tokiwa holding a Canon rangefinder camera, in a period when photography was very much a male pursuit in Japan.[n 4]
The text of the book is interrupted by four sections of photographs, taken between 1952 and 1957 (captions and technical data appear on pp. 242–241[n 5]). There is a title on the first photograph of each; these are:
Aru machi no kurai onna no iru fūkei (i.e. "The dark scenery with women of a certain Japanese town"). Mostly street scenes within this town (Yokohama) many showing girls and US servicemen. On pp. 44–45 appears Tokiwa's most famous photograph,[n 6] taken in Wakaba-chō Bā-gai (若葉町バー街, bar street), behind Isezakichō,[5] showing a girl held down by a foreign man while another in uniform looks away.
Kiken na hakimono (i.e. "Dangerous footwear"). The opening photograph shows geta and sandals discarded at the entrance to a hospital; the photographs that follow show girls waiting for or having injections and mandatory checks of freedom from venereal diseases.
Fāsutofurekkusu kara Kyanon made (as explained above). A complex series: foreign visitors to Japan, ama, nude modelling, and chindon'ya.
Kōfuku e no iriguchi no aru ie (as explained above). Happier scenes of young women – although the series ends with the scene shown within the lens on the cover.
Kōtarō Iizawa calls the book "the strongest, most compassionate work by female photographer of that era."[11]
Television work
From 1962 to 1965 Tokiwa produced the television series Hataraku Josei-tachi (働く女性たち, Working women).[3]
Other photography and publications
Tokiwa photographed around US military bases in Yokosuka (1958) and the Ryūkyū islands (1960), the Soviet Union (1974, and Taiwan and Malaysia (1975–80). Since 1985, she worked on issues involving the elderly.[5]
No book has yet (early 2010) been devoted to the later work of Tokiwa, but from the 1950s until the 1970s her work appeared in the magazines Asahi Camera, Camera Mainichi, Nippon Camera, Sankei Camera, and Shashin Salon [Wikidata].[3]
In November 2010, when she spoke (on the 23rd) to the Japan Professional Photographers Society's 60th anniversary photo exhibition "Women" in Yokohama[12] to an audience of about a hundred on her early days as a photographer, she was living in Yokohama and working on photographing people with Alzheimer's disease.[13]
Other work
In 1967 Tokiwa joined a committee choosing work for exhibition by Kanagawa Prefecture, and in 1987 she taught at Fujisawa Bunka Sentā (Fujisawa, Kanagawa).[14]
Exhibitions
In 1957, Tokiwa joined Tōmatsu, Narahara and others in the first exhibition of Jūnin no Me (10人の目, The Eyes of Ten). Until 1960, Tokiwa presented her work in several exhibitions, at least once together with Hisae Imai.[3][14]
The 3rd Month of Photography Tokyo showcased a variety of photograph exhibitions at various galleries in Tokyo in 1998. The main theme was "The Eye of Women Photographers" (Josei Shashinka no Manazashi), and it exhibited photographs by Tokiwa and other established Japanese women photographers of the 1945–1997 period.[15]
Tokiwa joined the Yokohama Photo Triangle exhibition in 2009, held as a part of the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port of Yokohama, where she also organized a civic participation program.[6]

Bella AkhmadulinaAkhmadulina in 2005Native nameБелла АхмадулинаBornIzabella Akhatovna Akhmadulina(1937-04-10)10 April 1937Moscow, Soviet UnionDied29 November 2010(2010-11-29) (aged 73)Peredelkino, RussiaOccupationPoet, writer, translatorAlma materMaxim Gorky Literature InstitutePeriod1955–2010[1]Literary movementRussian New WaveNotable worksThe String, Fever, Music Lessons, The Candle (poetry collections)Spouse
Izabella Akhatovna Akhmadulina (Russian: Бе́лла (Изабе́лла) Аха́товна Ахмаду́лина, Tatar: Белла Әхәт кызы Әхмәдуллина; 10 April 1937 – 29 November 2010) was a Soviet and Russian poet, short story writer, and translator, known for her apolitical writing stance.[2] She was part of the Russian New Wave literary movement.[3] She was cited by Joseph Brodsky as the best living poet in the Russian language.[3][4][5] She is known in Russia as "the voice of the epoch".
Despite the aforementioned apolitical stance of her writing, Akhmadulina was often critical of authorities in the Soviet Union,[1] and spoke out in favour of others, including Nobel laureates Boris Pasternak, Andrei Sakharov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.[2] She was known to international audiences via her travels abroad during the Khrushchev Thaw, during which she made appearances in sold-out stadiums.[citation needed] Upon her death in 2010 at the age of 73, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev hailed her poetry as a "classic of Russian literature."[5]
The New York Times said Akhmadulina was "always recognized as one of the Soviet Union's literary treasures and a classic poet in the long line extending from Lermontov and Pushkin."[2] Sonia I. Ketchian, writing in The Poetic Craft of Bella Akhmadulina, called her "one of the great poets of the 20th century. There's Akhmatova, Tsvetaeva, Mandelstam, and Pasternak – and she's the fifth".[2]
Early life, education and works
Bella Akhmadulina was born in Moscow on 10 April 1937, the only child of Akhat Valeevich Akhmadulin, a Tatar father and Nadezhda Makarovna Lazareva, a Russian-Italian mother.[2][6][7] They underwent evacuation to Kazan when World War II broke out.[2]
Akhmadulina's literary career began when she was a school-girl working as a journalist at the Moscow newspaper, Metrostroevets, and improving her poetic skills at a circle organized by the poet Yevgeny Vinokurov. Her first poems appeared in the magazine October after being approved by established Soviet poets.[citation needed] These first poems were published in 1955.[1] Émigré critic Marc Slonim described her prospects as follows in 1964 (Soviet Russian Literature): "Her voice has such a purity of tone, such richness of timbre, such individuality of diction, that if her growth continues she will be able some day to succeed Akhmatova" as "the greatest living woman poet in Russia".[2]
After finishing school, Akhmadulina entered the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute from which she graduated in 1960. While studying at the institute, she published her poems and articles in different newspapers, both official and handwritten. She was the subject of criticism in Komsomolskaya Pravda in 1957.[6] She was expelled in 1959 (but allowed re-entry as time progressed) as a result of her opposition to the persecution of Boris Pasternak.[8] In 1962 the first collection of her poems, titled Struna (The String), was published[6][9] and was a resounding success. In spite of being expunged, many of her collections of verses were published later: Music lessons (1970),[9] Poems (1975), Candle (1977),[9] Dreams of Georgia (1977), The Mystery (1983),[9] Coastline (1991), and others. A collection called Sad (Garden) led to Akhmadulina receiving the USSR State Prize in 1989.[6][9]
"Many dogs and one dog", a short story written in a surreal style, was published in 1979 in Samizdat's Metropol Almanac.[citation needed] She assisted in the creation of Metropol.[6] She wrote essays about Alexander Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov.[6]
She appeared in sold-out stadiums in the 1960s, as did the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky and Robert Rozhdestvensky.[citation needed]
Her open letter was published supporting the exiled Andrei Sakharov.[10] In October 1993, she signed the Letter of Forty-Two.[11]
Bella participated in many international poetry events including Kuala Lumpur International Poetry Reading (1988).[12]
After the Soviet Union she published Casket and Key (1994), A Guiding Sound (1995) and One Day in December (1996).[2]
Translations
The main themes of Akhmadulina's works are friendship, love, and relations between people. She wrote numerous essays about Russian poets and translators, some devoted to her close friend, Bulat Okudzhava. Akhmadulina avoided writing overtly political poems, but took part in political events in her youth, supporting the so-called "dissident movement". She translated Russian poetry from France, Italy, Chechnya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, and many others.
Akhmadulina wrote in a "resolutely apolitical" style.[2] She made use of imagery and humour in her work.[2] She used rhymed quatrains in her early works, which discussed ordinary, yet imaginative occurrences from daily life in language that was full of both archaisms and neologisms.[2] Religion and philosophy became her themes as she aged and she wrote in longer forms.[2]
Personal life

Bella's first marriage in 1954 was to Yevgeny Yevtushenko, another famous poet of the era; her second husband, whom she married in 1960, was Yuri Nagibin, a major novelist and screenwriter. Her third marriage in 1971 to film director Eldar Kuliev produced a daughter, Elizaveta Kulieva, who is also a poet.[13] In 1974, she married her last husband, the famous artist and stage designer Boris Messerer. They had homes in Peredelkino and Moscow.
Death
Akhmadulina died at her home in Peredelkino near Moscow on 29 November 2010 at the age of 73. Akhmadulina's husband said her death was from a heart condition,[5] describing it as a "cardiovascular crisis".[6] Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin both paid tribute,[9] with Medvedev writing on his blog that the death was an "irreparable loss".[5] Medevdev also wrote that Akhmadulina's poetry was a "classic of Russian literature".[5]

Baltasar Corrada del Río (April 10, 1935 – March 11, 2018) was a Puerto Rican politician. He held various high political offices in the island, including President of the Puerto Rico Civil Rights Commission,  Resident Commissioner (1977–1985), Mayor of the capital city of San Juan (1985–1989), Puerto Rico's 15th Secretary of State (1993–1995) and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1995–2005). He was also the unsuccessful NPP candidate for Governor in the elections of 1988.
Education
Corrada del Río obtained his high school diploma from Colegio Ponceño de Varones in 1952, and both his bachelor's degree in Social Studies in 1956 and his law degree from the University of Puerto Rico in 1959. He was admitted to the Puerto Rico Bar that year and practiced as a private lawyer from 1969 to 1975.[1]

In 1976, after initially expressing an interest in becoming Mayor of San Juan and running in an unofficial internal primary within the NPP, Corrada del Río was elected Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. 
During his tenure (1977–1985), he advocated for the admission of Puerto Rico into the Union and  co-founded the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Corrada served as Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, from 1985 to 1989 (having won the 1984 mayoral election).
In the elections of 1988, Corrada made an unsuccessful bid to become Governor of Puerto Rico. He was defeated by incumbent Governor Rafael Hernández Colón.
In January 1993, Pedro Rosselló became Governor and appointed Corrada as Puerto Rico's 15th Secretary of State. Later, in 1995, Rosselló appointed Corrada as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. He took the oath of office on July 15, 1995, after unanimous confirmation in the Senate of Puerto Rico. During his tenure as Associate Justice, Corrada was among the moderate/conservative voices in the Court, usually adhering to strict interpretations of the Constitution while practicing a firm type of judicial restraint.
The Constitution of Puerto Rico mandates an obligatory retirement for the Justices of the Supreme Court at age 70. Corrada arrived at this age in April, 2005, and was forced to retire. Prior to his retirement, Corrada publicly asked for an amendment to the Constitution that would repeal the obligatory retirement age for the justices, arguing that by obligating people to retire the constitution is discriminating by reason of age.  At the time of its enactment in 1952, the average life expectancy in Puerto Rico was 61 years, 9 less than the mandatory retirement age.  In 2013, the mandatory retirement age was 9 years less than the average life expectancy of 79.
The Court seat left vacant by Corrada remained vacant until 2009. Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá did not nominate anyone for the position after then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock made it clear in his inaugural speech as Senate president in 2005 that only a well-qualified statehooder would muster the votes for Senate confirmation to Court seats previously held by statehooders in order to assure "balance" on the bench.  He was eventually succeeded in 2009 by Rafael Martinez-Torres, appointed by a Corrada protege, governor Luis Fortuño.
Upon his retirement from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, he announced that he would abstain from political activity for one year, and, on 14 March 2006, he announced that within a month would begin attending New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico meetings, as former party president, to provide discrete advice.  He also publicly disagreed with then-party president Pedro Rossello by objecting to the expulsion of then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock and then-Vice President Orlando Parga from the party for refusing to turn over the Senate presidency to Rossello. The expulsion was later revoked by the Supreme Court.
Personal life
He was the brother of Álvaro Corrada del Rio, Roman Catholic Bishop of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and of a Roman Catholic nun.  Another of his sisters was the Puerto Rico Independence Party candidate for mayor of San Juan in 1988, when he was elected to the post.  He was married to Beatriz Betances, who served as First Lady of San Juan during his term as mayor, and had one daughter, Ana Isabel, three sons: Juan Carlos, Jose and Francisco; as well as several grandchildren: James Gregg, Michael Gregg, Alexis Marie, and Mayra.  In 2013 his wife died he was too ill to travel for the funeral services held in Morovis, Puerto Rico.[2]
Death
Baltasar Corrada del Río died on Sunday March 11, 2018, in Fort Myers, Florida at 82 years of age. By the time of his death he suffered from Alzheimer's disease. His ashes were interred at the farm where he was born in Morovis, Puerto Rico on March 24, 2018.
Honors and recognitions
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) issued a medal honoring Corrada and three other founding members.
In 2010, former Puerto Rico Secretary of State McClintock designated the department's summer internship program as the Baltasar Corrada del Río State Department Internship Program. Distinguished students such as Josue Rivera, former National President of the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, participated in the First Class of interns.
On November 24, 2010, a ceremony was held at the Puerto Rico Department of State to announce the publication of Baltasar Corrada Del Río-Sus opiniones 1995-2005 a book containing excerpts from 61 of his Supreme Court opinions edited by Pontifical Catholic University Law School dean Angel González Román, at which Acting Governor Kenneth McClintock and Chief Justice Federico Hernandez Denton were the keynote speakers.

Antonio GasallaBorn (1941-03-09) March 9, 1941 (age 83)Ramos MejíaNationalityArgentine
Antonio Gasalla (born March 9, 1941) is an Argentine actor, comedian, and theatre director.
Life and work
Antonio Gasalla was born in Ramos Mejía, a western suburb of Buenos Aires, in 1941.[1] He enrolled at the National Dramatic Arts Conservatory, and began his work in Buenos Aires' vibrant theatre scene in 1964 as an understudy, by which he befriended a colleague, Uruguayan émigré Carlos Perciavalle. He and Perciavalle starred in their production of María Inés Quesada's Help Valentino! (1966), which they performed as a café-concert; this genre was popular in Argentina at the time, and the Gasalla-Perciavalle duo became among its best known exponents.[2]
They accepted roles in film productions of Un viaje de locos (Madmen's Journey) and Clínica con música (Musical Clinic) in 1974. Though known for their comedy roles, they were also cast in 1974 by Sergio Renán for La tregua (The Truce), the first Argentine film nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.[3] The duo parted ways subsequently, and Gasalla was cast in a comic role in Tiro al aire (Shot in the Dark), a 1980 family film starring Héctor Alterio.[4]
Offbeat film director Alejandro Doria offered Gasalla the lead role in a 1985 comedy, Esperando la carroza (Waiting for the Hearse). Portraying Mamá Cora, a mischievous nonagenarian in need of attention from her self-absorbed family, Gasalla underwent four hours of prosthetic and makeup work daily, while shooting lasted. Receiving mixed reviews, the grotesque comedy was a commercial success and introduced Gasalla to a new act: female impersonation.[5]
He appeared seldom on television work until 1990, when he was offered a comedy show, El Mundo de Gasalla (Gasalla's World), following which he hosted or starred in numerous other variety programs on Argentine television, mostly for Channel 9. The most popular of these was El palacio de la risa (The Palace of Laughter), where television audiences became acquainted with his feminine roles. His comic portrayals earned his first Martín Fierro Award, the most prestigious in Argentine entertainment, in 1994.[6]
Having had a falling out twenty years earlier, Gasalla and his erstwhile café-concert partner, Carlos Perciavalle, were reunited in a 1997-98 theatrical series in Punta del Este, Uruguay.[7] Gasalla then returned to film in 2000, portraying Fredy, a homosexual man, in Almejas y mejillones (Clams and Mussels), and to the theatre, where he portrayed his numerous female characters from 2000 to 2004.[4]
Ending his hiatus from television in 2004, he hosted Gasalla en pantalla (Gasalla on the Screen) and portrayed "grandma," an irreverent elderly woman, for Susana Giménez's popular variety show. This role earned him another Martín Fierro Prize.[2] Collaborating in homages to the late comedian Niní Marshall in 2005 and for the Maipo Theatre's centennial in 2008, he also portrayed Argentine President Cristina Kirchner in Nito Artaza's Cristina en el país de las maravillas (Cristina in Wonderland).[8] Gasalla more recently directed Hernán Casciari's Más respeto que soy tu madre (More Respect - I'm Your Mother), playing the title role, as well.[9]
Gasalla remains among the most successful Argentine theatre and television personalities.[10] Following a May 4, 2009, guest appearance in Marcelo Tinelli's Showmatch (as Olga, the opinionated make-up lady), the popular variety show's ratings reportedly jumped to some of the highest in local television history.[11] His success on the stage earned him a standing as the "king of Corrientes Avenue."[12]
Female impersonation

Gasalla's female impersonations remain the hallmark of his career not only for his intricate portrayals, but also for their sheer number. Some of the best-known over the years have included:[2]
Inesita: a high-society maven frequently under her plastic surgeon's knife (often with disastrous consequences).
Yolanda: an elderly, hypochondriac woman psychologically attached to her wheelchair.
Flora: an inflexible, petty public servant (roughly equivalent to Lily Tomlin's Ernestine the operator).

Antonio Magsaysay Diaz (September 6, 1927 – August 3, 2011) was a politician and lawyer. He was elected to the House of Representatives of the Philippines representing Zambales for three separate tenures – 1969 to 1972, 1992 to 2001, and 2004 until his death on August 3, 2011.[2]
Early life
Diaz, a nephew of the late-president Ramon Magsaysay, member of the Magsaysay political clan of Zambales, was variously the vice governor and representative of the province since the 1960s.
According to a statement from the family, Diaz gave the bulk of his pork barrel funds to his scholarship program which included the provision of tuition money and stipends to some 500,000 high school and college students not only in his district but in the entire province. In the last 10 years, Diaz allocated approximately P500 million for this program alone.[1]
Records from Diaz's office showed that public school students in the district receive at least P1,000 each a year while those in private schools get at least P4,000 each. Camat said the funds given to students are supplemented by bonuses and other forms of assistance given to the scholars and their families. He said the scholarship program was the key to Diaz's political clout with voters in the province.[citation needed]
He made his career in government service, starting out as deputy customs commissioner (1963–1964), head of the legal department of the Land Reform Commission (1964–1965), and was subsequently elected vice governor of Zambales (1967–1969), before winning the first of many congressional terms in 1969. He was also a member of the Batasang Pambansa in 1984. Diaz's mother, Mercedes, is a sister of the late President Ramon Magsaysay.[citation needed]

Maneka Gandhi (also spelled Menaka; née Anand) (born 26 August 1956) is an Indian politician, animal rights activist, and environmentalist. She is a member of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She is the widow of Indian politician Sanjay Gandhi. She has been a minister in four governments, most recently in Narendra Modi's government from May 2014 to May 2019.
She also authored a number of books in the areas of etymology, law and animal welfare.
Personal life
Maneka Anand was born on 26 August 1956 in Delhi, India into a Sikh family. Her father was an Indian Army officer Lt. Col. Tarlochan Singh Anand and her mother was Amardeep Kaur Anand, daughter of Sir Datar Singh. She was educated at The Lawrence School, Sanawar[1] and later at Lady Shri Ram College for Women.[2][3] She subsequently studied German at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.[4]
Maneka first met Sanjay Gandhi in 1973 at a cocktail party thrown by her uncle, Major-General Kapur, to celebrate the forthcoming marriage of his son. Maneka married Gandhi, the son of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, one year later on 23 September 1974.[5]
The Emergency of 1975–77 saw the rise of Sanjay into politics and Maneka was seen with him almost every time on his tours as she helped him in campaigns. It is often said that during the Emergency, Sanjay had total control over his mother (Indira) and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office).[6][7][8]
Maneka Gandhi founded the news magazine Surya which later played a key role in promotion of the Congress party after its defeat in the 1977 election following the Emergency.
Gandhi went to court to fight an attempt by the government in power at the time to confiscate her passport and won a landmark decision on personal liberty. In the case of Maneka Gandhi v Union of India,[9] the court found that "Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratic setup."
In 1980, Gandhi gave birth to a son, Feroze, named after his paternal grandfather. Her mother-in-law added the name Varun. Gandhi was just twenty-three years old, and her son just 100 days old, when her husband died in an air crash.[10]
Early life and career
Maneka's relationship with Indira Gandhi gradually disintegrated after Sanjay's death and they would continually argue with one another. Maneka was eventually forced out of 1, Safdarjung Road, the prime minister's residence, after a fallout with Indira.[3] On 3 April 1983, she founded the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch along with Akbar Ahmad.[11] The party primarily focused on youth empowerment and employment. It won four out of five seats in the Elections in Andhra Pradesh.
Gandhi published The Complete Book of Muslim and Parsi Names, in recognition of her husband's Zoroastrian faith.[12][13]
Gandhi contested the Amethi constituency from Uttar Pradesh for the 1984 general election for the Lok Sabha, but lost to Rajiv Gandhi. In 1988, she joined V. P. Singh's Janata Dal Party and became the General Secretary. In the 1989 Indian general election, Gandhi won her first election to Parliament and became a Minister of State as the Minister for Environment.[15]
Activism
Gandhi is an environmentalist and animal rights leader in India.[16] She has earned international awards and acclaim.[17] She was appointed chairwoman of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) in 1995. Under her direction, CPCSEA members carried unannounced inspections of laboratories where animals are used for scientific research were conducted.[18]
In 1996, Gandhi protested the opening of the first McDonald's restaurant in India. Justifying her protest, she stated that "we don't need cow killers in India".[19]
Gandhi has filed Public Interest Litigations that have achieved the replacement of the municipal killing of homeless dogs with a sterilisation programme (Animal Birth Control programs, commonly abbreviated as ABCs), the unregulated sale of airguns and a ban on mobile or travelling zoos. She currently chairs the Jury of International Energy Globe Foundation which meets annually in Austria to award the best environmental innovations of the year.  She is a member of the Eurosolar Board and the Wuppertal Institute, Germany.
Gandhi started the organisation People for Animals[20] in 1992 and it is the largest organisation for animal rights/welfare in India. Gandhi is also a patron of International Animal Rescue. While she is not a vegan,[21] she has advocated this lifestyle on ethical and health grounds. She also anchored the weekly television program Heads and Tails, highlighting the suffering meted out to animals due to their commercial exploitation. She has also authored a book under the same title. Her other books were about Indian people names. She is a cast member for the documentary A Delicate Balance.[22]
In September 2023, Maneka Gandhi came out in support of Saving Dol Ka Badh forest in Jaipur. And wrote a letter to chief secretary of Rajasthan giving examples of how and why the forest should be protected.[23]
Criticism
In June 2021, she called a veterinarian, threatening to cancel his license for am allegedly botched up amputation surgery of a dog. Despite a veterinarian was trying to make her aware of the situation that he has exercised all due care during surgery and it was a ferocious dog which had torn-up bandages and surgical wounds after surgery, she hurled abusive and unparliamentary words. The call was recorded and was made viral on social media. All veterinary associations have condemned and protested her behavior.[24]
In June 2017, during a Facebook Live session, she commented that men do not commit suicide. She received negative responses to the comment and spent the rest of the chat answering questions related to this, with chatters pointing out that 68% of the suicide cases reported in India were committed by men.[25]
In January 2021, Deepika Narayan Bharadwaj came forward with an audio tape where Maneka Gandhi was allegedly berating a man for hitting a dog, and was threatening to file sexual harassment cases against him. The man on the tape claimed that it was in self defense, as the dog had bitten his daughter.[26][27]
In March 2017, she said that an early curfew for girls in hostels helped young women control their "hormonal outbursts" and received a backlash for the comment.[28]
In 2016, she stated that she was against the criminalization of marital rape and received a heavy backlash for the comment.[29][30]
Police in Kerala booked Gandhi the basis of complaints against her for promoting hatred by levelling accusations coated with communal overtones for a death of a pregnant elephant, against residents in the Muslim-majority district of Malappuram in June 2020. While the elephant died in Mannarcad, Palakkad district, nearly 90 km from Malappuram, BJP leaders including Gandhi targeted the only Muslim-majority district of Kerala.[31][32] She said: “It’s a murder. Malappuram is famous for such incidents, it’s India’s most violent district. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300–400 birds & dogs die at one time”.[33][34] [35] She was charged with adding communal color to an animal-related issue that would otherwise be constrained within the Department of Forests.[36] A group calling themselves Kerala Cyber Warriors briefly hacked Maneka Gandhi's website, People for Animals, India.[37][38]

Then in 2022, she played Beth, the second wife of the character played by Hugh Jackman, in the drama film The Son directed by Florian Zeller from a screenplay written by himself and Christopher Hampton.[48] The Son had its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, and despite the mixed reviews from critics of the movie, the performances of Jackman and Kirby were praised. Clayton Davis, for Variety, said: "Kirby is reinventing the wheel of acting with a masterfully executed physical portrayal".[49]
Kirby reprised her role of Alanna Mitsopolis, alias the White Widow, in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)[50] and the untitled sequel eighth Mission: Impossible film (2025).[51] In 2022, she replaced Jodie Comer as Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais, Napoleon Bonaparte's first wife,[52] in the historical drama film Napoleon (2023) with Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, and directed by Ridley Scott.[53]
In February 2024, Kirby joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe and she will play the role of Susan Storm / Invisible Woman in film The Fantastic Four which is scheduled to be released on July 25, 2025 as part o

Sir Lees Knowles, 1st Baronet, KStJ, CVO (16 February 1857 – 7 October 1928) was a British barrister, military historian and Conservative politician.[1]
Early life
Knowles was the son of John Knowles and Elizabeth Lees of Green Bank, Oldham, Lancashire whose family owned Andrew Knowles and Sons, collieries in the Irwell Valley. He was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Cambridge.[2] He was a prominent athlete at both institutions and became president of the Cambridge University Athletics Club. He studied law, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1882.[1]
Career
Politics
Knowles was involved in Unionist politics, and stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives at Leigh in the 1885 general election. In the following year, another general election was held, and he was returned as Member of Parliament for Salford West.
From 1887 to 1892, Knowles held an appointment as unpaid parliamentary secretary to Charles Ritchie, President of the Local Government Board.  On 24 April 1890, he brought a motion before the House of Commons and was subsequently appointed to formulate the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis.[3]
Knowles remained unpaid parliamentary secretary when Ritchie became President of the Board of Trade in 1895. From 1896 to 1906, he was Second Church Estates Commissioner. He was created a baronet, "of Westwood in the County of Lancaster", in the 1903 Birthday Honours.[4]
In December 1904, he was knighted as a Knight of Grace of the Order of Saint John (KStJ).[5]
His parliamentary career came to an end when he lost his seat at the 1906 general election.[6]
Military
Knowles had a great interest in military history, and wrote a number of books on the life of Napoleon. In 1912 he made a bequest to his alma mater, Trinity College. This established the Lees Knowles Lectureship, an annual series of talks on military science given by distinguished military and naval figures.
He held a commission as an officer in the Volunteer Force and its successor the Territorial Force, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After a stint as Honorary Colonel of the 3rd (Volunteer) battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers, he was on 14 May 1902 appointed lieutenant-colonel in command of the battalion.[7] At various times he commanded the 3rd, 7th and 8th battalions of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He subsequently became the vice-chairman of the Lancashire Territorial Army Association.
Knowles was a philanthropist, supporting a number of charities, notably the Guinness Trust for Housing the Poor. He died in on 7 October 1928, aged 71, at his home in Westwood, Pendlebury.[8]
Family
In 1915, Knowles married Lady Nina Ogilvy-Grant, youngest daughter of Francis Ogilvy-Grant, 10th Earl of Seafield. Lady Nina was presumably the Lady Nina Ogilvy-Grant who appeared at a meeting of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association on 11 May 1909 at 52 Portland Place in London, as reported by Votes for Women, the organ of the Women's Social and Political Union.[9] They had no children.[8]

Liam James Payne (born 29 August 1993) is an English singer. He rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction. Payne made his debut as a singer in 2008 when he auditioned for the British television series The X Factor. After being eliminated in the competition, he auditioned again in 2010 and was put into a group with four other contestants to form One Direction, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.[2][3] Payne worked with other producers under the monikers "Big Payno" and "Payno" creating remixes for songs by his group and Cheryl.[4]
After One Direction's hiatus, Payne signed a recording deal with Republic Records in North America.[5] In May 2017, Payne released "Strip That Down" as the lead single from his debut album. It peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100, being certified platinum in both countries. His debut album, LP1, was released in December 2019. He has sold over 18 million singles in under three years since One Direction's hiatus, and over 3.9 billion career streams in that span.[6][7]
Liam James Payne was born at New Cross Hospital in the Heath Town district of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. He is the son of Karen Payne, an infant nurse, and Geoff Payne, a fitter. He has two older sisters, Nicola and Ruth Payne.[8] Payne was born three weeks early, getting ill frequently. Until the age of four, Payne had regular tests done in hospital as doctors noticed one of his kidneys was scarred and dysfunctional. To help cope with the pain, he had sixteen injections in his arm every morning and another sixteen every evening as a child.[9] As a student, Payne was heavily involved in sports, particularly cross country running. Payne originally joined the Wolverhampton and Bilston Athletics Club to pursue his running career. For three years he was ranked in the top three 1500m runners in the country within his age group.[10][11]
As he was dealing with bullying from some older students in secondary school, he took up boxing lessons at the age of twelve.[12] Payne completed 11 GCSEs at St Peter's Collegiate School (now St Peter's Collegiate Academy) before moving on to study music technology at City of Wolverhampton College.[3]
Payne was first introduced to the world of show business at age twelve as a member of the Pink Productions Theatre Company, even appearing as Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever.[13] Payne had previously performed in front of a crowd of 26,000 during a Wolverhampton Wanderers football match.[3][14]
Payne first auditioned for the fifth series of The X Factor in 2008, at just 14 years old, in front of judges Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh. Payne moved past the first round after performing Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the Moon". He was subsequently cut at the Boot Camp stage, but Cowell then changed his mind and asked Payne to return for the judges' houses stage.[15] Payne was cut again during judges' houses, but was encouraged by Cowell to "come back in two years".[16]
Payne returned to the show in 2010 for the seventh series, auditioning in front of Cowell, Cole, Walsh and guest judge Natalie Imbruglia. He sang the Michael Bublé version of "Cry Me a River", which earned him four yeses and a standing ovation from Cowell. Payne was considered the second favourite to win the competition following his solo audition.[17] He failed to progress to the "Boys" category at judges' houses, but after a suggestion by guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, Payne, along with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, during the bootcamp stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the "Groups" category.[18] Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at Judges' houses, and their first song as a group, they performed an acoustic version of "Torn". Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well." The group quickly gained popularity in the UK, ultimately coming in third place on the show.[19]
Following The X Factor, One Direction were signed to Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment.[20] A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was released in February 2011 and topped The Sunday Times' Best Seller list. Their debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful", was released in September 2011, and was a commercial and international success, reaching number one in several countries.[21] Their debut album, Up All Night, was released in Ireland and the UK of November of that same year, charting at number one and number two, respectively. The album was released worldwide in March 2012, and One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.[22] Following the release of the album, the group headlined the Up All Night Tour. Originally intended with shows taking place only in the UK and Ireland,[23] Australian and North American legs of the tour were added due to demand.[24] A commercial success, tickets for the tour sold out in minutes and garnered positive reviews from critics who applauded the band's singing abilities and stage presence. The band released Up All Night: The Live Tour, a video album documenting the tour, in May 2012. That same month, One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, was published and topped The New York Times Best Seller list.[25]
In September 2012, "Live While We're Young", the lead single from the group's second album, was released, and was a global success. Another single, "Little Things", spawned the band's second number one single in the UK.[26] In November 2012, the group released their second album, Take Me Home, and it reached number one in over 35 countries. Reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the group became the first boy band in US chart history to record two number-one albums in the same calendar year alongside becoming the first group since 2008 to record two number-one albums in the same year.[27] Following the release of the album, the group embarked on their second headlining concert tour, the Take Me Home Tour. Performing 123 shows in North America, Asia, Oceania, and Europe, grossing $114 million. During the tour, One Direction covered Wheatus's "Teenage Dirtbag". In the original song lead vocalist Brendan Brown performs a segment in a "female voice" which, in One Direction's rendition of the song Payne covered in falsetto. This garnered praise from Brown, who commented, "You can do my girl part anytime."[28] In August 2013, One Direction: This Is Us, a 3-D documentary concert film was released, accumalting a box office gross of $68.5 million.[29] One Direction's third book, One Direction: Where We Are: Our Band, Our Story: 100% Official, was released that same month.[30]
The group's third album, Midnight Memories, was released in November of that same year. It was the best-selling album worldwide in 2013 with 4 million copies sold globally.[31] The album's lead single, "Best Song Ever", is their highest-charting single in the US to date.[32] The group embarked on their third headline tour, the Where We Are Tour. Tickets sold out in minutes,[33][34] and more shows were added due to "overwhelming demand."[35] The tour was their first all-stadium tour, averaging 49,848 fans per show.[36] In total, the tour grossed over $290 million and was the highest-grossing tour of 2014, the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time, and is still the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[37] The tour was attended by 3.4 million fans.[36] In September 2014, One Direction's fourth book, One Direction: Who We Are: Our Official Autobiography was released. The group's second concert film, One Direction: Where We Are – The Concert Film, was released in October 2014, showing footage of the band's shows at San Siro Stadium in Milan, Italy. In November 2014, the group's fourth album, Four, was released, making it the last album to include Zayn Malik. Singles "Steal My Girl" and "Night Changes" were released, both achieving platinum status in the US among other countries.[38][39] The album debuted number one in 18 countries, selling 3.2 million copies.[40] One Direction became the only group in the 58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.[41] The group embarked on their fourth headlining world tour, the On the Road Again Tour, grossing $208 million and selling 2.3 million tickets. In November 2015, One Direction's fifth album, Made in the A.M., was released. Singles "Drag Me Down" and "Perfect" both debuted at number one in various countries, and the album reached number one in the UK and number two on the US Billboard 200. Following the release of the album, the group went on an indefinite hiatus.
Following the departure of former member Zayn Malik, Payne was tasked with taking over the bulk of Malik's vocals.[42] Bandmate Harry Styles admitted, "Liam [Payne] stepped up to do the high notes. He kicks them in the bollocks every show. He doesn't hold back."[43]
Payne was known as one of the principal songwriters in One Direction, credited for co-writing more than half of the songs on the band's third and fourth album.[44][45]
Payne began working as a producer under the monikers "Big Payno" or "Payno", teaming up with fellow producers AfterHrs to remix several tracks including Cheryl Cole's "I Don't Care" in 2014.[46] Some EDM websites noted Payne's remixes were venturing into future house.[47][48][49] Payne is also credited with writing Cole's "I Won't Break", off her album Only Human.
In August 2014, Payne created and became director of Hampton Music Limited, a publishing company under which his solo projects will appear.[50][51] Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer is signed to One Mode Productions Limited, on which Payne serves as one of the directors.[52]
Payne began working on future projects collaborating with Juicy J on seven tracks with more in the works,[53][54] DJ Mustard,[55] and Miguel.[56] He has also been in the studio with producer and performing artist Pharrell Williams.[57] Payne also contacted The Collective member and YouTube musician and producer Will Singe.[58]
In 2015, Payne collaborated with songwriter Jamie Scott on Irish band Hometown's single "The Night We Met".[59] In early 201

Hopeton Overton Brown (born 18 April 1960 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a recording engineer and producer who rose to fame in the 1980s mixing dub music as "Scientist". A protégé of King Tubby (Osbourne Ruddock), Scientist's contemporaries include several figures who, working at King Tubby's studio, had helped pioneer the genre in the 1970s: Ruddock, Bunny Lee, Philip Smart, Pat Kelly and Prince Jammy.
The 1970s: King Tubby's, Channel One, and Studio One
Scientist was introduced to electronics by his father, who worked as a television and radio repair technician.[1] He began building his own amplifiers and would buy transformers from Tubby's Dromilly Road studio. While at the studio, Scientist asked Tubby to give him a chance at mixing. He was taken on at Tubby's as an assistant, performing tasks such as winding transformer coils, and began working as a mixer in the mid-1970s, initially creating dubs of reworked Studio One tracks for Don Mais's Roots Tradition label, given his chance when Prince Jammy cut short a mixing session for Mais because he was too tired to continue.[1] His name originated from a comment by Bunny Lee to Tubby, with regard to his technical proficiency, "Damn, this little boy must be a scientist."[2]
He left King Tubby's at the end of the 1970s and became the principal engineer for Channel One when hired by the Hoo Kim brothers, giving him the chance to work on a 16-track mixing desk rather than the four tracks at Tubby's.[1][3]
The 1980s: King Tubby's, Tuff Gong
Scientist came to prominence in the early 1980s and produced many albums, his mixes featuring on many releases in the first part of the decade. He made a series of albums in the early 1980s, released on Greensleeves Records with titles themed around Scientist's fictional achievements in fighting Space Invaders, Pac-Men, and Vampires, and winning the World Cup.[1] The music on these albums was played by Roots Radics, his most frequent collaborators. In particular, he was the favourite engineer of Henry "Junjo" Lawes, for whom he mixed several albums featuring Roots Radics, many based on tracks by Barrington Levy.[1][3]  He also did a lot of work for Linval Thompson and Jah Thomas.[1] In 1982 he left Channel One to work at Tuff Gong studio as second engineer to Errol Brown.[1]
Scientist worked as an engineer in recording studios in the Washington, D.C. area starting in 1985.[1]
Licensing issues
Scientist has alleged in court that Greensleeves originally released albums without his knowledge, according to his interview with United Reggae online magazine.[4] After this, Dub Мир label began working directly with Scientist to reissue his best-known work. In 2016, Greensleeves removed the Scientist moniker for a run of reissues, substituting titles such as Junjo Presents: Wins The World Cup.[5]

<s> In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Álvarez and the second or maternal family name is  Barragán.
Canelo ÁlvarezÁlvarez in 2017BornSantos Saúl Álvarez Barragán (1990-07-18) 18 July 1990 (age 33)Guadalajara, Jalisco, MexicoOther namesCanelo ("Cinnamon")StatisticsWeight(s)
Santos Saúl Álvarez Barragán (Latin American Spanish: [saˈul ˈalβaɾes]; born 18 July 1990), commonly known as Canelo,[2] is a Mexican professional boxer. He has held multiple world championships in four weight classes from light middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal titles in two. Álvarez is the first and only boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super middleweight, having held the World Boxing Association (WBA) (Super version), World Boxing Council (WBC) and Ring magazine titles since 2020, and the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) titles since 2021.
Álvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher.[3][4] As of September 2023, Álvarez is ranked as the second best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec.[5] One of boxing's biggest ever pay-per-view stars,[6]
he is consistently one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, making Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes in 2019, 2022, and 2023.[7][8][9]
In an interview, Álvarez explained that he was born on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Jalisco, but his family is originally from Los Reyes, Michoacán.[10] At the age of five, his family moved to their current home of Juanacatlán, Jalisco.[11] Growing up on his family's farm, he learned horseback riding, which he continues today.[12][13] Álvarez is the youngest of eight children, seven of them boys; all of his brothers also became professional boxers.[14] Among his brothers are welterweight boxers Ramón Álvarez, Ricardo Álvarez and former WBA interim world champion, Rigoberto Álvarez.[15]
Canelo in Spanish is the masculine word for cinnamon, which is a common nickname for people with red hair.[16] In Mexico, it is common for people to associate red hair with the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico in the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the Mexican–American War. Speaking about his ancestry, Álvarez once said, "There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past."[15][17]
Canelo's neighbors nicknamed him "Jícama con Chile", which translates as jicama with chilli flakes – a popular snack in Mexico.[18]
Álvarez started boxing when he was around 13 years old, after watching his older brother Rigoberto debut as a professional boxer.[19] In 2004, he won the silver medal at the Junior Mexican National Championships, held in Sinaloa. He became the 2005 Junior Mexican National Boxing Champion in Tuxtla Gutiérrez at the age of 15. His amateur record was 44–2 with 12 knockouts.[20]
Álvarez turned professional at 15, shortly after his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out eleven of his 13 documented opponents, all of whom were significantly older. The elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that Álvarez had fought ten more times in that span, winning all ten by knockout (KO), but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth the trouble to seek to have the record corrected.[14] Were this to be verified, his record would be 67–2–2 with 49 knockouts. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the light welterweight limit of 140 lbs before he settled in the welterweight division at 147 lbs.[21]
Álvarez's third official bout of his career was a win over future IBF lightweight champion Miguel Vázquez on 20 January 2006, in his home town of Guadalajara, Jalisco. On 28 June 2008, Álvarez defeated Vázquez again in a rematch. He also made world history on that fight card when he and all six of his brothers fought on the same night, with Canelo being the youngest.[22][23][24] The only downside was that three of them failed to win their pro debuts. The other four more experienced brothers won.[25] On 6 March 2010, he got a crushing third-round KO over Brian Camechis in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas.[26] Álvarez then defeated José Cotto on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Shane Mosley to retain his WBC-NABF welterweight title.[27]
His sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Luciano Leonel Cuello for the WBC Silver light middleweight title was held at the Vicente Fernández Arena.[28] During the post-fight interview, Mexican singer Vicente Fernández gave Álvarez a horse. He was also given a horse by the mayor of Tepic, where Álvarez sometimes trains.[29]
He next faced the former WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard.[30] Baldomir stated in a pre-fight interview that he wanted the winner of Mora vs. Mosley, as he said "after I knock out El Canelo."[31] Baldomir weighed in at 153.4 lbs for the bout, that was contracted for 151 lbs. In California, if a fighter is overweight he is penalized 20% of his purse and that percent is given to the other fighter. However, Álvarez declined to take the extra $12,000 from Baldomir.[32] In the sixth round, Álvarez landed a crushing blow that knocked Baldomir out cold. With the victory, Álvarez became just the second boxer ever to stop Carlos Baldomir and the first boxer ever to knock him out.[33] Álvarez then successfully defended his light middleweight title by unanimous decision against former world champion Lovemore N'dou in Veracruz.[34] It was a competitive fight despite the wide margins on the official scorecards of 119–109, 120–108, and 120–108.
Álvarez was in line as mandatory challenger for the winner of the vacant WBC light middleweight title bout between Manny Pacquiao and Antonio Margarito, however, Pacquiao who was the victor, wrote to the WBC stating he had no intention of defending the title and it was declared vacant.[35] On 5 March 2011, Álvarez defeated European welterweight champion Matthew Hatton via unanimous decision, for the vacant WBC light middleweight belt. The bout was televised on HBO and took place at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California.[36] Álvarez was docked a point in the seventh round, which was uniformly scored 9–9, for hitting after the break. All three ringside judges scored the bout 119–108 in favor of Álvarez, who landed 47% of his 626 punches, including 53% of his power shots. Hatton connected with just 25% of his 546 total blows[37] in a fight that averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.[38]
Álvarez successfully defended his newly awarded WBC title against #4 ranked Ring light middleweight and current European light middleweight champion Ryan Rhodes.[39][40][41] Álvarez defeated Rhodes via TKO in the twelfth round on 18 June 2011, in Guadalajara, Jalisco.[41][42] The fight averaged 1.6 million viewers on HBO.[38]
On 17 September 2011, Álvarez successfully defended that same WBC title against The Contender competitor Alfonso Gómez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, winning via TKO in the sixth round. Gómez won a majority of the first five rounds after Álvarez knocked him down in the first round. Álvarez was looking for one shot and got it in the sixth round when he backed Gómez up with a right hand. He then followed up with a flurry to get the referee to jump in and stop the fight.[43]
Álvarez defeated Kermit Cintrón via TKO in the fifth round. Álvarez spent the first three rounds feeling out his opponent Cintrón, a former welterweight champion, before punishing the Puerto Rican with body shots and straight right hands in the fourth round. He knocked Cintrón down once and had him in trouble at the end of the round, but Cintrón was saved by the bell. In the fifth round, Cintrón came out and caught Álvarez with some combinations, but Álvarez eventually overpowered him with several powerful straight right hands and the referee stepped in and stopped it.[44] The fight averaged 1.5 million viewers on HBO: Boxing After Dark.[38]
Richard Schaefer announced that Álvarez's next bout would co-feature on the undercard of Miguel Cotto's clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. On 11 February 2012, Shane Mosley was announced as Álvarez's next opponent in May for his WBC light middleweight title.[45] Álvarez defeated Mosley via unanimous decision after twelve rounds.[46]
Álvarez was originally set to fight top ten Ring light middleweight and former welterweight champion Paul Williams on 15 September 2012. However, on 27 May 2012, a motorcycle accident in the U.S. state of Georgia paralyzed Williams from the waist down, ending his boxing career. Álvarez's possible opponents for his September bout were James Kirkland, Austin Trout, Delvin Rodriguez and most notably, Victor Ortiz.
Álvarez was scheduled to defend his title against former welterweight titlist Victor Ortiz in the main event of a Showtime pay-per-view (PPV) card dubbed 'Knockout Kings' at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, on 23 June, Ortiz was unable to defeat underdog Josesito López in what was supposed to be a "tune-up" fight at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, losing due to referee stoppage (broken jaw) and cancelling his bout with Álvarez as a result.
Due to this upset, López was instead penciled in to face Canelo at the MGM Grand on 15 September, for Álvarez's WBC light middleweight title.[47] Álvarez won the fight via fifth-round TKO after dominating López from start to finish, staying undefeated and increasing his record of 41–0–1.[48] The fight averaged 1.04 million on Showtime.[49] Canelo earned $2 million for the fight and López a smaller amount of $212,500.[50]
His next fight took place on 20 April 2013, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas against Austin Trout. The fight was supposed to take place during Cinco de Mayo weekend as the co-main event to Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Robert Guerrero; however, due to a contract disagreement between Álvarez and Mayweather regarding their potentia

Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993[1]), also known by her stage name IU (아이유), is a South Korean singer-songwriter, composer, and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with Lost and Found (2008), her first extended play (EP). Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of "Good Day", the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.[2]
With the success of her 2011 albums, Real+ and Last Fantasy, IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's "little sister".[3][4] 2011 also saw her first foray into songwriting with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the television series The Greatest Love. IU's third studio album, Modern Times (2013), showcased a more mature musical style that marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 on the Gaon Digital Chart. The album was ranked number two on Billboard's "25 Greatest K-Pop Albums of the 2010s" list.[5] IU subsequently exerted more creative control over her music; Chat-Shire marked the first time she was credited as the sole lyricist of her own album.[6] IU's fourth studio album, Palette (2017), became her first to reach number one on Billboard's World Albums chart. While her following records Love Poem and Lilac continued to deviate from mainstream K-pop styles, exploring and mixing various music genres, IU consistently retained her dominance on South Korean music charts.[7][8][9]
Her 2020 single "Eight" became her first to reach number one on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart.[10]
Aside from her music career, IU has ventured into acting and hosting radio and television shows. Following her supporting role in teen drama Dream High (2011) and minor appearances in several television series, she was cast in leading roles in television drama series You Are the Best! (2013), Pretty Man (2013–14), The Producers (2015) and Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016). IU's role as a desperate office worker in My Mister (2018) received critical acclaim, and she earned her first Best Actress in Television nomination at the 55th Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2019, she starred in anthology film series Persona and fantasy television series Hotel del Luna, the latter of which led to her second Best Actress nomination at the Baeksang Arts Awards. In 2022, IU starred in Hirokazu Kore-eda's film Broker alongside Song Kang-ho, Bae Doona and Gang Dong-won.
IU has released a total of five studio albums and nine EPs, five of which have reached number one on the Gaon Album Chart, and thirty number-one singles, making her the artist with the most number-one songs in South Korea. One of the best-selling solo acts in the group-dominated K-pop industry,[11] IU became the first solo female K-pop act to perform at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena during the Seoul leg of her 2019 Love, Poem concert tour [12] and also the first Korean female artist to hold a solo concert, The Golden Hour, at Seoul Olympic Stadium in Seoul on September 17 and 18, 2022.[13] Rolling Stone named her the 135th greatest singer of all time in a 2023 ranking.[14] She has been included five times in the top ten of Forbes magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity list since 2012 and attained a peak ranking of number three that year.[15] In 2014, Billboard recognized IU as the all-time leader of its K-pop Hot 100 with the most number-one songs and the artist with the most weeks at the number-one position on the chart.[16] She was named Gallup Korea's Singer of the Year in 2014 and in 2017.[17][18]
Early life
IU was born Lee Ji-eun on May 16, 1993, in Songjeong-dong, Seoul, South Korea.[19][20] According to IU, she was born into the Jeonju Yi clan, the same clan as the former Korean monarchy.[21] At an early age, IU showed interest in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and began attending acting classes.[22] Following her elementary school years, her family's financial situation deteriorated, and they eventually moved to the nearby Uijeongbu, in Gyeonggi Province.[23] She and her younger brother lived apart from their parents in a studio room with their grandmother and cousin for over one year in conditions of great poverty.[24][25] IU had little contact with her parents over this period of time, but felt reassured under her grandmother's care.[25]
During her middle school years, IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school's sports competition.[26] She attended 20 auditions but failed to succeed in any of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies.[27][28] She later trained at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyo-seong.[29] After signing with LOEN Entertainment in 2007, she moved to Bangbae, Seoul.[30] Due to her poor living conditions at the time, IU stated that she "loved being at the studio", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep.[25]
Her burgeoning career led to her decreased attendance at school and declining grades, with the exception of Korean literature.[31] After graduating from Dongduk Girls' High School [ko] in 2012, IU decided not to pursue post-secondary education in tandem with her singing career.[32]
Career
2008–2009: Career beginnings
After training for ten months, IU made her debut in 2008 under her stage name, conceived by LOEN to mean "I and You become one through music."[33] She performed her debut single, "Lost Child" (Korean: 미아), live for the first time on the music program M Countdown on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer.[34] IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her during the performance and initially felt discouraged by it, although she now considers it a beneficial experience.[35] "Lost Child" is the lead single from her debut extended play (EP) Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the "Rookie of the Month" by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November that same year.[36] However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now."[31]
On April 23, 2009, IU launched her first studio album, Growing Up, with the lead promotional single, "Boo". She began her album promotion the next day, performing "Boo" on KBS2's Music Bank.[37] The song was noted for its stark contrast in musical style to "Lost Child", which was described as a "heavy" and "dark" ballad compared to the 1980s "retro sound" of "Boo".[38][39] Deemed as a "strategic" transformation, the dance choreography, stage costume and hairstyle shown in live performances were used to emphasize her youthfulness and project a "cute" image.[38][40] Although it drew a favorable response from the public, IU, who was fifteen years old at the time, admitted that the image made her feel awkward.[40] Several songs from Lost and Found were featured on her debut studio album Growing Up, including "You Know" (있잖아); a new rock-style arrangement of the song was released as the follow-up single to "Boo". Towards the end of 2009, IU released her second EP, IU...IM. She began promoting its lead single, "Marshmallow" (마쉬멜로우), on music programs from November 13, 2009. Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of Happy Together that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions.[41] The performances were well-received and were once again labelled "cute", reminiscent of reviews for "Boo".[42]
As her popularity began to rise, IU made more frequent appearances on variety shows, performing on Star Golden Bell, Kim Jung-eun's Chocolate, and You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook. Her acoustic covers of other artists' songs such as Girls' Generation's "Gee", Super Junior's "Sorry, Sorry", and Big Bang's "Lies" featured in these live performances gained tremendous interest online.[43] In late 2009, she became a television presenter for the first time, hosting a weekly music chart show on Gom TV,[44] while appearing as a fixed guest on multiple radio programs such as Kiss the Radio, Volume Up, MBC Standard FM's Starry Night and MBC FM4U's Best Friend Radio.[45][46]
2010–2011: Rising popularity and acting debut
On June 3, 2010, IU released "Nagging", a duet which she recorded with 2AM's Lim Seul-ong. The single debuted at twelve on the Gaon Digital Chart and shot up to the number-one position the following week, where it remained for three weeks.[47] Written by Kim Eana and composed by Lee Min-soo, the pop ballad duet was used as one of the theme songs for the second season of the variety show We Got Married.[48] Soon after, IU released "Because I'm a Woman" (여자라서), one of the theme songs of MBC's historical drama, Road No. 1. The song peaked at number six on the Gaon Digital Chart.[49] IU's collaboration with Sung Si-kyung on "It's You" (그대네요) for his album, The First, debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.[50]
A 21-second sample of "Good Day", the lead single from Real. IU was noted for the "wide range" of her voice, while the song's popularity was ascribed to its lyrics and high-pitched climax.[51][52]
IU's third EP, Real, was released on December 9, 2010. Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol and Choi Gap-won, Real debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart.[53][54] The lead single, "Good Da

Personal detailsBornc. 1824Died1887Political partyRepublicanMilitary serviceAllegiance United StatesRanksergeantUnit1st South Carolina VolunteersBattles/warsCivil War
Prince R. Rivers (c. 1824–1887) was a former enslaved man from South Carolina who served as a soldier in the Union Army and as a state politician during the Reconstruction era. He escaped and joined Union lines, becoming a sergeant in the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, a Union regiment in the American Civil War.[1]
He had gained literacy as an enslaved man and after the war joined the Republican Party. He served as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, becoming known as an orator. He was one of three African-American founders of Aiken County in 1871, helped pick the site for the courthouse, and served as the state legislator from the county through 1874. He also served as a trial judge.
Early life and education
Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina, Prince R. Rivers worked on the Henry Middleton Stuart, Sr. (1803–1872) or H.M. Stuart plantation known as Oak Point or Pages Point. He served with the household staff and as carriage driver,[2] among the elite of the estate's slaves, and learned to read and write. He escaped from slavery in 1862 after his master moved with his slaves to Edgefield County. Rivers stole one of Stuart's horses and rode through the Confederate lines to Beaufort, which was occupied by Union troops.[3] He volunteered to enlist in the Union Army with the First South Carolina Volunteers. By the summer of 1862, more than 10,000 slaves had fled from Lowcountry and Midlands plantations to join Union lines along the coast.[4]
Serving the Union Army
Rivers was among the slaves (and their families) declared free in 1862 by Union General David Hunter under Congress' Confiscation Act of 1861. Hunter's decision was considered controversial, and the general was prohibited from enlisting former slaves. But they served in "Hunter's Regiment" with unpaid status for a time, and Rivers said he never regretted it.[2]
In 1863, Rivers became a non-commissioned officer in the newly formed 1st South Carolina Volunteers of the United States Colored Troops. His commanding officer, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, wanted to promote him to a commissioned rank but was prevented by his superiors because of Rivers' race. Higginson said of Rivers in an 1865 article in The Liberator, "No anti-slavery novel has described a man of such marked ability. He makes Toussaint perfectly intelligible; and if there should ever be a black monarchy in South Carolina, he will be its king."[2][5]
The 1st South Carolina Volunteers and other African-American soldiers were promised at enlistment in writing to be paid the same as other soldiers.  However, under the Militia Act of 1862, were paid less than half that.  They and their supporters lobbied the government but did not gain full pay until June 1864, when an Act of Congress granted them equal pay, including what they were due retroactively. Nearly 180,000 African Americans served in the war and were critical to Union victory.
Reconstruction era
After the war, Rivers returned to the Edgefield District, eventually settling on a farm outside Hamburg, which became a black-majority town in this period, with a thriving community. He entered the Republican Party and became active in state politics. He had reportedly learned to read and write while a slave, and proved to be a skilled orator and essayist.[6] He served as registrar for Edgefield County in 1867. In the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1868, he was the delegate from Edgefield.[7]
He was elected as a state legislator and later as a trial judge, and was deeply involved with Reconstruction politics. Rivers was one of three African-American founders of Aiken County, established by the state legislature in 1871 during Reconstruction, and he helped pick the site for the county courthouse. After a redistricting in 1872, Rivers was the state representative from the newly organized Aiken County. He later served as mayor, county coroner and justice of the peace, all local offices newly available to black candidates.[6]
In 1876, Prince Rivers was the judge in a hearing in Hamburg related to events on July 4, when white farmers claimed that an all-black unit of the National Guard blocked the street by their parade on Independence Day. The hearing was attended by more than 100 armed members from nearby Red Shirts chapters, among the thousands of armed white men in rifle clubs; the farmers' lawyer demanded that the black militia be disarmed. Though Rivers tried in a separate meeting to persuade the local Guard militia to give up their weapons, and the white paramilitary to back down, his efforts failed. The freedmen retreated to the armory and held off an attack by the white militia, in which one white man died. They tried to escape after seeing the white militia bring up a cannon. Two blacks were killed on the street, and the white militia captured about 25 freedmen who had left the armory. They murdered four outright later that night while holding them as prisoners at what was called the Dead Ring, and wounded seven other black men.[8][9]
After the trial, Rivers' home was burned and property stolen or destroyed by Red Shirts. Violence continued in the following weeks as the white militia worked to suppress black voting in the Upland counties, with a massacre of an estimated 30-100 blacks over several days in September in Ellenton.[10] The Democrats regained control of the state legislature and governor's office in 1876, in an election marked by fraud. It was settled in a national compromise by which the Republican administration agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, officially ending Reconstruction.
In South Carolina, white Democrats passed laws to impose segregation and "Jim Crow", and continued violence at elections, but African-American George Henry White was elected to US Congress in the 1890s. In 1895 the Democrats passed a new constitution that included requirements that effectively disfranchised blacks in the state. After the rise of whites and imposition of white supremacy, Rivers worked as a house painter and coachman until his death at age 65.[11]

Francesco Mimbelli (16 April 1903, in Livorno – 26 January 1978, in Rome) was an Italian naval officer who fought in World War II.
Biography
Early life
Mimbelli came from a Livornese family with links to Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik). He entered the Italian Naval Academy in 1918 and graduated as an ensign in 1923. In the late 1920s he served on Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) gunboats in China. Promoted to lieutenant he served on the Italian delegation to the London Naval Conference in 1930. He subsequently served on the cruiser Trento moving to the torpedo boat arm in 1937, subsequently being promoted to frigate captain and serving in the Navy Ministry. On the outbreak of war he was appointed to command a torpedo boat flotilla.
Crete
Mimbelli was the commander of torpedo boat Lupo which fought in the Battle of Crete. On the night of May 21,  1941, the Royal Navy took advantage of the darkness to evade the Luftwaffe and then scatter a German invasion convoy of two thousand German troops approaching Crete. Mimbelli was responsible for defending the convoy. Mimbelli engaged three British light cruisers at point-blank range, taking 18 six-inch hits but driving off the warships before they could sink all the transports and machine-gun helpless survivors in the water. Although the odds were heavily stacked against him (one torpedo boat against the seven ships of Force D) more than two-thirds of the convoy survived due to Mimbelli's maneuvers.[1]
Black Sea
He was later appointed commander of the Italian naval forces based in the Black Sea, where he commanded IV MAS Flotilla, consisting of 8 MAS boats, 6 CB-class midget submarines, 5 MTs and five MTSMs. The Italian motorboats sank two submarines (S-32 and Shch-306) in the first week of operations. After this severe loss, the remaining Russian submarines were withdrawn.[2]
Between the end of June and the beginning of July, 1942, the Italian MAS participated, along with the Germans and the Romanians, in the capture of Sevastopol and Balaklava. Between May and July, the MAS completed 65 missions, while the motor torpedo boats and the midget submarines completed 56 and 24 respectively.[3] On 29 June, Admiral Karlgeorg Schuster (Commander-in-Chief of Naval-Group-Command South of the Kriegsmarine) transmitted to Admiral Arturo Riccardi his personal congratulations, citing in an official radio broadcast 'the fighting spirit of the Italian crews under the command of Captain Francesco Mimbelli.'[4]
On the night between 2 and 3 August 1942, MAS 573, MAS 568, and MAS 569 attacked the heavy cruiser Molotov and the destroyer Kharkov out on a mission to intercept a German transport operation southwest of Kerch. They torpedoed the Soviet cruiser Molotov which was not repaired until after the end of the conflict.[5][6]
On 26 August 1943, Italian CB-4 midget submarine torpedoed and sank the Soviet Shchuka-class submarine Shch-203.[7][8][9][10]
Post War
In 1946 Mimbelli joined the Italian Navy (Marina Militare) and was appointed captain of the cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. He was subsequently promoted to rear admiral and became commander of the Italian Naval Academy. He retired as a vice admiral in 1964 and died on 26 January 1978, in Rome.[11]
Commemoration
In 1992 the Italian Durand de la Penne-class destroyer Francesco Mimbelli was named in his honour.[12]

<s> This article is about the Brazilian footballer. For the Portuguese footballer, see Cristiano Ronaldo. For other footballers named Ronaldo, see Ronaldo (disambiguation) § Association footballers.
In this Portuguese name, the first or maternal family name is Nazário and the second or paternal family name is de Lima.
Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁoˈnawdu ˈlwiz nɐˈzaɾju dʒi ˈlimɐ]; born 18 September 1976),[2] known as Ronaldo or Ronaldo Nazário, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is the owner of Brasileiro Série A club Cruzeiro and owner and president of Segunda Division club Real Valladolid. Nicknamed O Fenômeno ('The Phenomenon') and R9, he is considered one of the greatest players of all time. As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position, Ronaldo has been an influence for a generation of strikers that have followed. His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times and winning two Ballon d'Or awards.
Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994. He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world record transfer fee and at 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the youngest recipient of the award. In 1997, Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo, making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. At 21, he received the 1997 Ballon d'Or and remains the youngest recipient of the award. By the age of 23, Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club and country. However, after a series of knee injuries and recuperation, he was inactive for almost three years. Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title. He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011, having suffered further injuries.
Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national team. At age 17, he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament after he helped Brazil reach the final, where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off. He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. Ronaldo scored twice in the final and received the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer. This achievement, viewed  as "redemption" for what occurred at the previous World Cup, saw Ronaldo named the 2002 FIFA World Player of the Year, receive the 2002 Ballon d'Or, and for his return from injury, won the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, a tournament record at the time. He also won the 1997 Copa América, where he became the player of the tournament and the 1999 Copa América, where he was the top goalscorer.
Ronaldo was one of the most marketable sportsmen in the world during his playing career. He was named in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by Pelé and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, Italian Football Hall of Fame, Inter Milan Hall of Fame and Real Madrid Hall of Fame. In 2020, Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI published by France Football magazine. Ronaldo has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, a position to which he was appointed in 2000. Ronaldo became the majority owner of Real Valladolid in September 2018, after buying 51% of the club's shares. In December 2021, he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro, investing $70 million in the club.
Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in Itaguaí as the third child of Nélio Nazário de Lima Snr. and Sônia dos Santos Barata.[6][7] Ronaldo has a brother, Nélio Jr.[7][8] His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football.[9] He played on the streets of Bento Ribeiro, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His mother states: "I always found him on the street playing ball with friends when he should have been in school. I know, I lost my battle."[9] He joined the Social Ramos futsal team at the age of 12 and led the city's youth league in scoring with a record 166 goals in his first season which included scoring 11 of his team's 12 goals in a single game.[7][9] Crediting futsal for developing his skills, Ronaldo has said, "futsal will always be my first love."[10][11][12] His coach from Social Ramos, Alirio Carvalho, says: "What was special about Ronaldo was his attitude. It was as if he had come from the moon. Nothing disturbed him, nothing overawed him, nothing threw him off his game."[13]
Spotted by former Brazilian player Jairzinho, who was coaching São Cristóvão, Ronaldo played for the São Cristóvão youth team.[14] Under the guidance of coach Alfredo Sampaio, he progressed quickly through the ranks, playing for the clubs' under-17 and under-20 teams while only 15.[13] Ronaldo's agents in Brazil, Reinaldo Pitta and Alexandre Martins, signed him as a 13-year-old. Pitta stated: "We saw right away that he could be something different than most other players."[9] Recognized as a child prodigy, Jairzinho recommended the then 16-year-old to his former club Cruzeiro.[15]
Ronaldo quickly attracted attention from big clubs, and his agents rejected offers from Botafogo and São Paulo. He was turned down by Flamengo, the team he supported as a boy, after missing practice due to an inability to afford the fare for the hour-long bus ride.[9][16] Jairzinho saw Ronaldo's potential and helped get him a move to Cruzeiro.[9] Ronaldo's agents accepted an offer of €50,000 from the club, and he scored four goals on his youth team debut.[13]
Three months after arriving at Cruzeiro, Ronaldo made his professional debut on 25 May 1993 against Caldense in the Minas Gerais State Championship.[13][17] His first senior goal came in a friendly during a tour of Portugal, scoring a goal against Belenenses and generally impressing new coach Carlos Alberto Silva, enough to become a first team regular.[13] During the tour, his performance against Porto impressed enough that they bid $500,000, which was turned down by club president César Masci.[13]
Upon returning from the 1993 summer tour, he would score 20 goals in 21 games for Cruzeiro until the end of the year. On 5 October 1993 he scored his first senior career hat-trick against Chilean side Colo-Colo (6-1) in the first home leg of the Supercopa Libertadores.[18] He scored two more in the second leg, further three against Uruguayan team Nacional, and finished as the tournament's top-scorer with 8 goals,[13] being the youngest to do so in the history of the Supercopa Libertadores.
On 7 November 1993 he came to national public attention once more by scoring five goals in Cruzeiro's 6-0 home win against Bahia[19] in the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and became the youngest South-American in history to score a league hat-trick, only behind Pelé.[20][21]
Ronaldo scored a total of 44 goals in 47 games with Cruzeiro in two seasons, leading them to their first Copa do Brasil in 1993, and the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1994.[22]
Ronaldo joined PSV after the 1994 World Cup. He was selected for the tournament despite being just 17, but did not play in any games. His Brazil teammate Romário having played for PSV from 1988 to 1993 advised Ronaldo to move to the club.[23][24] On 28 August 1994, Ronaldo scored ten minutes into his debut against Vitesse, and scored a brace on his home debut against Go Ahead Eagles.[24] He scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands, which included seven braces and a hat-trick against Utrecht.[24] After scoring a hat-trick in PSV's game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi Völler stated in a post match press conference, "Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way."[23] His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport, with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating, "I'd seen him on television at PSV and thought ‘wow'. Then he came to Barcelona. He's the most spectacular player I've ever seen. He did things I'd never seen before. We're now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players, but not then. Ronaldo was a beast."[25]
Nick Miller, match reporter for The Guardian, writes: "What's striking about Ronaldo in that first year at PSV is how complete he looks, even as a skinny teenager. Everything that would come to define him – the lightning pace, the blurry stepovers, the implausible impression that he was faster with the ball than without it, even the exceptional upper-body strength – was all there."[23] Rob Smyth added, "In many ways Ronaldo was the first PlayStation footballer. His stepover was a form of hypnosis, and his signature trick, the elastico, could certainly have come from a computer screen."[26] Ronaldo's second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign, but he still averaged nearly a goal a game, scoring 19 goals in 21 appearances,[23] including a UEFA Cup four-goal haul against Finnish side MyPa.[24] With PSV, Ronaldo won the Dutch Cup in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995.[27] In his two seasons at the club he scored 54 goals in 58 games.[28]
Ronaldo scoring the winning penalty for Barcelona in the 1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final against Paris Saint-Germain
During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and Barcelona. It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then-world record fee of $19.5 million, and he joined the club on 17 July 1996.[28] According to manager Bobby Robson, he signed an eight-year contract, and would play up front alone.[29]
During the 1996–97 season, Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of Christ the Redeemer that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro.[28] He helped Barcelona to the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title, capping the season with the winning goal in the final, and to a win in the 1996 Supercopa de España.[30] He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games, and the European Golden Shoe.[31] Until the 2008–09 season, Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga.[31]

Milton DiamondDiamond in 2010Born (1934-03-06) March 6, 1934 (age 90)New York City, U.S.[1]Alma materCity College of New York (BS)University of Kansas (PhD)Known forFollowing up the case of David ReimerScientific careerFieldsThe study of human sexualityInstitutionsUniversity of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa
Milton Diamond (born March 6, 1934) is an American Professor Emeritus of anatomy and reproductive biology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.[2] After a career in the study of human sexuality, Diamond retired from the university in December 2009 but continued with his research and writing until retiring fully in 2018.[3]
Early career
Milton Diamond graduated from the City College of New York with a BS in biophysics in 1955,[1] after which he spent three years in the Army as an engineering officer, stationed in Japan.[4] On returning to the United States, he attended graduate school at University of Kansas from 1958 to 1962 and earned a PhD in anatomy and psychology from that University.[4] His first job was teaching at the University of Louisville, School of Medicine where he simultaneously completed two years toward an Doctor of Medicine, passing his Basic Medicine Boards,[1] and in 1967 he moved to Hawaii to take up a post at the recently established John A. Burns School of Medicine. Milton Diamond had a long running feud with the psychologist Dr. John Money. In 1965 Diamond published "A Critical Evaluation of the Ontogeny of Human Sexual Behavior" a critique of Money's work. In the early seventies, Diamond and Money were attending a conference on transgenderism in Dubrovnik. According to the book As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl (page 174)[5] at this conference Money initiated a loud and aggressive argument with Diamond. One witness claims that Money punched Diamond; however, Diamond himself said that he could not recall any physical contact during this encounter.
David Reimer
Diamond is best known for following up on the case of David Reimer, a boy raised as a girl under the supervision of John Money after his penis was damaged beyond surgical repair during a botched circumcision, which was performed using an unconventional method of electrocauterization instead of a clamp and scalpel.[6][7] This case, which Money renamed that of "John/Joan" to protect Reimer's privacy, has become one of the most cited cases in the literature of psychiatry, anthropology, women's studies, child development, and biology of gender.[citation needed] With the cooperation of H. Keith Sigmundson, who had been Reimer's supervising psychiatrist, Diamond tracked down the adult Reimer and found that Money's sex reassignment of Reimer had failed. Diamond was the first to alert physicians that the model, proposed by Reimer's case, of how to treat infants with intersex conditions was faulty.[8]
Diamond recommended[9] that physicians should not perform surgery on intersex infants without their informed consent, should assign such infants to the gender to which they will probably best adjust, and refrain from adding shame, stigma and secrecy to the issue, by assisting intersex people to meet and associate with others of like condition. Diamond similarly encouraged considering the intersex condition as a difference of sex development, not as a disorder.[10]
Work, appointments and awards
Diamond wrote extensively about abortion and family planning, pornography, intersexuality, transsexuality, and other sex- and reproduction-related issues for professional sex and legal journals, as well as lay periodicals. He was frequently interviewed for public media and legal matters, and often served as an expert in court proceedings, and was known for his research on the origins and development of sexual identity. He retired from teaching in 2009, but continued to research and consult concerning transsexuality, intersexuality and pornography until he retired fully in 2018.
Appointments
Diamond was based at the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, from 1967.[4] He was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Reproductive Biology in 1971, and from 1985 until his retirement he was Director of the Pacific Center for Sex and Society[4] within the School of Medicine.
In 1999 Diamond was appointed as President of the International Academy of Sex Research,[11] and in 2001/02 as President of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.[12]
Awards
2005: the Norwegian Diversity Prize for his research efforts on behalf of transsexual and transgender people worldwide
2008: the first of a proposed annual award made by the German Intersex Society (Intersexuelle Menschen e.V.)[15] "for his decades-long commitment to the benefit of intersex people";[16]
2009: the Regents' Medal for Excellence in Research by the University of Hawaiʻi;[17]
2010: the Kinsey Award for 2011, made by the Midcontinent Region of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.[18]

<s> 1 Playing statistics correct to the end of 2016.2 State and international statistics correct as of 2008.Career highlights
James Ross Bartel (born 4 December 1983) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Geelong Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). A utility, 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) tall and weighing 89 kilograms (196 lb), Bartel contributed as a midfielder, forward, and defender.
Bartel made his AFL debut in 2002 and has garnered a long list of accolades and achievements. He is a triple premiership player, a Brownlow Medalist, Norm Smith Medalist, and a two-time All-Australian. Bartel is one of only two AFL players, along with Simon Black, to have won a Brownlow Medal, a Norm Smith Medal and played over 300 AFL games.
Early life
Bartel was born to Terry Bartel[1] and Dianne Bennett in Geelong, Victoria. He spent much of his childhood in Herne Hill without his father. When his parents divorced while he was just one year old, Bartel's mother was left to raise him and his two elder sisters, Olivia and Emma, by herself.[2]
After beginning his junior football at Bell Park, Bartel went on to attend renowned footballing school St. Joseph's College, where his talent for sports became evident early.[3] Bartel displayed initial promise as a cricketer, representing the 'Joeys' in 1st XI cricket as a 16-year-old, and winning the school's batting awards in both 2000 and 2001. This led to selection in the state under-17 team, before a switch in focus toward football instead saw Bartel selected to play for the Geelong Falcons team in the TAC Cup competition.[3] Although his age made him ineligible for the 2000 AFL Draft, Bartel garnered an impressive array of accolades and honours as a bottom-aged player. Bartel won mid-year State honours for Victoria Country in the AFL Under 18 Championships, with his performances in the championship games earning him end-of-year All-Australian honours and the Most Valuable Player award for Victoria Country. In addition, he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year, won a TAC Cup premiership medallion with the Geelong Falcons, and also claimed the best and fairest award while still only 16 years of age.[3]
Entering his second year with the Falcons, Bartel was rewarded with the team captaincy for the season.[3] Bartel again won mid-year state honours for Victoria Country and was additionally awarded the state captaincy. Although failing to repeat his previous success as national champion with Victoria Country, Bartel's individual performances saw him earn All-Australian honours and gain selection in the TAC Cup Team of the Year for the second consecutive season.[3]
AFL career
Early career (2002–2006)
The Geelong Football Club drafted Bartel with their first selection and the eighth overall draft pick in the 2001 AFL Draft.[3] After making his debut in the opening round of the 2002 AFL premiership season, which was a heavy defeat to Essendon, Bartel went on to play in 11 out of a possible 22 senior games over the year.[4] After gathering 21 disposals in round 4, Bartel was awarded an AFL Rising Star nomination.[3] Having been dropped back to the club's VFL team to play out the second half of the season, Bartel played a key part in helping a young Geelong reserves side capture the 2002 VFL Premiership.[3] In helping the Cats defeat Port Melbourne by 22 points, Bartel saw the club secure its first major piece of silverware since 1982.[5]
Despite an impressive debut season, Bartel struggled to maintain his spot within the team during the 2003 AFL season, featuring in only 13 senior games. Averaging just 12 disposals a game, Bartel was unable to help the Cats qualify for the finals series for the third successive season.[4] After just two senior appearances to begin the 2004 AFL season, Bartel was again dropped back to the VFL and instructed by coaching staff to work on particular aspects of his game. Despite compiling a series of impressive games in the VFL, Bartel was deliberately made to work hard over a two-month period before earning a round 10 recall into the senior side.[6] Bartel's re-introduction to the senior team coincided with Geelong winning ten out of their final twelve games and securing a top four spot ahead of the finals series. Although Geelong were eliminated in the preliminary final by reigning premiers Brisbane, Bartel's averages of 22 disposals and 5 tackles a game over the course of the season had seen him secure his position within the team's midfield rotation.[4] His performances during the second half of the season, during which he averaged 29 disposals and 5 tackles a game,[4] also saw him recognised as the highest-polling Geelong player—with 13 votes in total—during the 2004 Brownlow Medal count.
Bartel continued to build on his reputation as a tough, courageous midfielder during the 2005 AFL season, earning his first nomination for the AFLPA Robert Rose Award for Most Courageous Player in the league.[6] Averaging 19.6 disposals a game, Bartel again helped Geelong qualify for the season-ending finals series, where they met Sydney in the semi-finals. After developing a slim lead for much of the game, Geelong struggled to maintain their advantage during the final minutes of the match. Bartel was restricted to just 9 disposals as the Swans eventually won through to the preliminary finals, defeating Geelong by 3 points.

During the 2007 season, Bartel established himself as one of the premier ball-winning midfielders in the competition, averaging over 27 disposals per game—the second-highest possession average in the league—and finishing amongst the top 10 within the league for total disposals (632), total handballs (291), total tackles (122), and tackles per game (5.3).[4] After helping the Cats claim the McClelland Trophy, he was again nominated for the AFLPA Robert Rose Award as the game's most courageous player,[7] and was also rewarded with his first All-Australian jumper.[8]
Bartel's standout season continued when he was awarded the prestigious Brownlow Medal, winning with 29 votes—the highest number of votes ever by a Geelong medalist, and the third highest ever by any player under the current polling system—in a season that included eight best on ground performances.[9] Despite missing the final two games of the regular season due to a burst appendix,[9] Bartel also set an AFL record alongside teammate Gary Ablett, Jr., for polling the most combined votes ever by two players of the same club.[9] In addition, the pair combined with teammate Joel Corey to set another AFL record for most votes ever polled by three players of the same club, at 61 votes.[9] He capped off a fine season by winning his first premiership medallion when he helped Geelong claim the 2007 AFL Premiership. Bartel's 28 disposals, 5 marks, 5 tackles, and 2 goals in the 2007 AFL Grand Final helped the Cats claim an AFL-record 119-point victory over Port Adelaide.[4]
Another outstanding season for Bartel in 2008 saw him earn All-Australian honours for the second straight season. Bartel had 20 or more possessions in the 24 of 25 games that he played which included 3 finals, Bartel also had his best career game for possessions during the season, in round 14 when he picked up 41 possessions against Adelaide Bartel would finish the season second in disposals with 702, also finishing second in kicks with 382. Geelong would have another dominant season finishing first on the ladder four wins ahead of second they would once again make the Grand Final, but would fall short losing to Hawthorn by 26 points. Bartel also took part in the special one-off event that pitted the interstate stars of the league against the Victoria stars of the league it was Victoria vs. Dream Team the AFL created the one-off event to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Australian rules football. Bartel picked up 19 possessions as the Victoria team won by 17 points.
Bartel played his 150th game in 2009, round 18 against Adelaide this game also marked his 100th win as a player, Bartel also equaled his career high for disposals when he had 41 possessions against Melbourne in round 6. In round 17, Geelong was facing Hawthorn, and the game was tied 98–98. Bartel would take a mark just as the siren sounded; he would go on to kick a point, resulting in Geelong winning by one point, 99–98. Geelong would finish the season second on the ladder two wins behind first. Bartel was outstanding in the Preliminary final against Collingwood, he picked up 32 possessions and helped Geelong defeat Collingwood to make their third straight Grand Final. Bartel would have spectacular defensive game in the Grand Final with 16 tackles which are equal highest in AFL history and a Grand Final record. Geelong would go on to win the Grand Final by 12 points this being Bartel's second premiership.
Bartel had another strong season in 2010, picking up 630 possessions at the end of the season for the fourth year straight and laying 110 tackles for the fourth consecutive year. Once again Geelong would finish second on the ladder one win behind Collingwood. Bartel averaged 32 possessions during the three finals that Geelong played. Geelong was eliminated in the preliminary final when they lost by 41 points to Collingwood.
In 2011 Bartel played his 200th game in round 21 against Adelaide, also kicked a career-high 26 goals in the season from only 32 shots and once again had over 500 possessions in the season. Geelong would once again finish second, one win behind Collingwood. Geelong would make the Grand Final and beat Collingwood by 38 points. Bartel had a spectacular performance picking up 26 possessions and kicking three goals; this resulted in Bartel being the best player on the ground and winning the Norm Smith Medal award and also his Third Premiership.
Changing roles, injuries and continued individual success (2012–2015)
Bartel played most of the 2012 AFL Season with a stress fracture in his foot, despite this, he still had 20+ possessions in most of those games, which helped him produce his eighth straight 400+ possession season. Geelong finished sixth on the ladder which resulted in them playing an elimination final against seventh placed Fremantle. Despite 26 possessions from Bartel, Geelong lost by 16 points.
In 2013 Bartel would put together another solid season even though he moved from his usual Forward/Midfield role into the backline, specifically across half back. Bartel would gather 558 possessions for the season, the fifth time he has had over 550 in a season; his best possession game was in a win over the Brisbane Lions in round 23 when he had 35 possessions. Geelong would finish second on the ladder one win behind Hawthorn. Bartel played all 24 games of the season including three finals; Geelong would be eliminated in preliminary final losing to Hawthorn by 5 points, and Bartel Became Geelong's finals games record holder, having now played in 24 finals matches.
Bartel started the 2014 AFL Season by playing his 250th game in round 1 with a win over Adelaide Bartel would have 21 pos

Frederick Howard TaylorMissionary to China and AuthorBorn25 November 1862London, EnglandDied15 August 1946 (1946-08-16) (aged 83)EducationRoyal College of SurgeonsTitleMRCSSpouse
Frederick Howard Taylor a.k.a. F. Howard Taylor (25 November 1862 – 15 August 1946), was a British pioneer Protestant Christian missionary to China, author, speaker and second son of James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, and Maria Jane Dyer.[1]
Beginnings
Howard Taylor was three when his father founded the China Inland Mission. He was born in London during his parents’ first furlough in England together. In 1866 at the age of four he was taken with his parents, 3 siblings  and sixteen other missionaries to China aboard the Lammermuir (clipper) as part of the famous Lammermuir Party. During the 4-month long voyage the ship was nearly wrecked by 2 typhoons. His sister, Grace Dyer Taylor died of meningitis the first year.[2] When he was six the family was nearly killed by a rioting mob during the Yangzhou riot in 1868. Finally in 1870 he was sent home with his surviving siblings with Emily Blatchley to live in London, separated from his parents. His mother died in China soon after they arrived home in 1870.[3]
Like his father, he enrolled in the Royal London Hospital medical college, completing his diploma in 1888. Hudson Taylor lived to see his son, Howard follow in his footsteps to become a medical missionary to China. He received Doctor of Medicine from London University and subsequently became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons as well as a Member of the Royal College of Physicians. He was an extremely capable student and received three high honors in his postgraduate studies.
Howard Taylor always had a close relationship with his father. 1888 was a special year for both men. Hudson Taylor was on his first tour in North America sharing the missionary needs in China. Howard Taylor had taken three months leave to go along, having just ended his year of medical and surgical appointments. Howard Taylor showed a deep interest to go to China long term. Hearing his father speak at various meetings, particularly to young students, had a profound influence on Howard. On 15 October 1889, at a Missionary Convention organized by the Students Foreign Missionary Union more than 1500 students attended. Of these, 152 signed the pledge, "it is my earnest hope, if God permit, to engage in foreign missionary work." The first name in the book of members reads, " Taylor, F Howard, MD, MRCP, FRCS (England), the London Hospital."
He later noted:It was suggested by some of my fellow students that I was taking a rash step, that I was perhaps making a mistake in going and burying myself, as they said, amongst the heathen of China. I did not think so; I did not believe that any one who undertook to go forth and serve the Lord Jesus Christ would be found in the long run to be making a mistake, and I am thankful to be able to say now that it is better than I hoped.
On 3 November 1889 Howard Taylor, accompanying his father Hudson Taylor, arrived at Gothenburg, where they were met by Mr. Josef Holmgren, the Secretary of the Swedish Mission in China, who invited them over for special meetings to mobilize the Swedish Christians for China. He had arranged the whole of their tour and was their companion and interpreter throughout the trip. Twenty towns were visited, including Stockholm, Uppsala and Christiania, and 50-60,000 people were addressed, even Queen Sophia invited Mr. Taylor to a private audience in Stockholm. Hudson Taylor was already 57 at that time, and no longer enjoying the same vigor as his son. Yet his insistence on traveling third class and carrying his own suitcase continued to give the young soon-to-be missionary a model of servanthood.
Howard Taylor departed for China on 23 January 1890 from England as a single man. He married Mary Geraldine Guinness on 24 April 1894,[4] daughter of Rev. Henry Grattan Guinness, another CIM missionary who went to China two years earlier. He was sent to Henan and his leadership was displayed with the opening of the ministry in the province, including the significant medical work which continued into the next 30 years. Howard was the first missionary to visit Zhengzhou in Henan. As such, he was the only trained physician south of the Yellow River among 20 million Chinese.[5] In the spring of 1895 a mission station was opened as the result of the medical work for the previous three years at the invitation of Yuan Shikai, a rising political figure who later became President of China. Yuan, from Henan himself, called Howard Taylor one day to attend to his mother, dying of cancer. In recognition of his service, Li Hongzhang presented Howard Taylor with an honorific tablet.
Howard spoke with strong convictions about what he believed to be his calling:We were sent to work in a new district. In the providence of God we had the privilege of opening up two new stations - the city of Zhengzhou and the adjoining city, one day's journey away, of Taikang. We were the first missionaries to reside at these places, hence, speaking broadly, none of the people knew intelligently about the Lord Jesus Christ. Of course the very foundations of the work had to be laid, and they were laid, and laid deeply, at some cost. The medical work was a means which the Lord used very greatly in enabling us to get at the hearts and the affections of the people in those two cities and the surrounding districts. The work, of course, was of a very varied nature- a great many minor cases, a considerable sprinkling of major cases that required great thought and care and much prayer, for the danger of failure can hardly be over-estimated.  If we undertook to operate, for instance, on a case of cataract, and failed, it would very likely go abroad that we had taken away the patient’s eye or the patient’s sight- something out of the patient’s eye in order to make medicine, and the result might be that our lives would pay the forfeit. Such work is always carried on at considerable cost.
In 1894 he married Mary Geraldine Guinness, a childhood friend from his youth in Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London. Her father was Henry Grattan Guinness, the famous evangelist and preacher. Together Dr. and Mrs. Howard Taylor authored several books:
Published works
Hudson Taylor and The China Inland Mission Vol. 1 Hudson Taylor in Early Years: The Growth of a Soul 1911
Continued service
Mary Geraldine Guinness was a noteworthy missionary in her own right with a love of writing. She joined the CIM in 1888 and became one of the key biographers for the CIM. She served in Honan before they were married. She was already the author of a few books including "The Story of the China Inland Mission" and "In the Far East".
Howard Taylor took risks to serve the mission in China. In 1898, for nine months he was acting superintendent in Henan while suffering from intractable dysentery. When he asked to be replaced and freed to get proper treatment, his father, Hudson Taylor, confessed that he had no one available to take over. He urged Howard to stay on and Howard Taylor did.
In 1901, when the Student Volunteer Movement invited Dr. Howard Taylor and his wife to be the speakers among the colleges and universities.
Ten years after his service began in China, in 1900, he and his wife made a special tour of the American colleges, again at the invitation of the Student volunteer Missionary Union. This was considered one of the most notable campaigns ever conducted among North American institutions by secretaries of the Student Volunteer Movement on overseas missions. They began the mobilization tour in November 1900, continuing with some interruptions, until April 1901.
In less than 5 months, between November 1900 and April 1901, Dr Howard Taylor visited 77 different institutions of learning, including 40 medical schools, 10 theological seminaries, 21 universities and colleges, and six other schools. His aim was to present to medical students the opportunities for service on the mission field, so that only those other colleges could be visited that were in or near the largest cities. This work necessitated about 4000 miles of travel, as far north as Montreal and Minneapolis, and as far south as Baltimore and Nashville. Mrs. Taylor went to the women’s colleges of the eastern states.  By January they were traveling together on Canadian and western tours. In all, Mrs. Taylor visited nearly as many institutions as did her husband. Their contribution was so much appreciated that the Student Volunteer Movement invited them to become traveling speakers for a whole year in 1912.
On Saturday 3 June 1905 Howard and Geraldine were there when Hudson Taylor died at Changsha. They had been traveling with him since April visiting the different mission stations along the Yangtze, calling at various ports, to Hankow, then by rail into Henan, and finally to Changsha, the capital of Hunan. At the memorial service held at the China Inland Mission Hall in Shanghai on 13 June, Dr. Howard Taylor spoke about his father’s life, quoting from Hudson Taylor and how his father constantly challenged him, Does it not say that we ought to lay down our lives for the [Chinese] brethen?
In February 1922, Howard and his wife were kidnapped by a bandit leader in Yunnan named Pu Shuming. They were subsequently released. Geraldine recorded the events of the ordeal in "With P’u and His Brigands".
Howard spoke about medical missionary work in China:The first then, and incomparably the most important qualification for Medical missionary service is love; love that can be felt, that practises as well as preaches.

Zamfir Constantin Arbore (Romanian pronunciation: [zamˈfir konstanˈtin ˈarbore]; born Zamfir Ralli, Russian: Земфирий Константинович Арборе-Ралли, Zemfiriyi Konstantinovich Arborye-Ralli; also known as Zamfir Arbure, Zamfir Rally, Zemphiri Ralli and Aivaza;[1] November 14, 1848 – April 2 or April 3, 1933) was a Bukovinian-born Romanian political activist originally active in the Russian Empire, also known for his work as an amateur historian, geographer and ethnographer. Arbore debuted in left-wing politics from early in life, gained an intimate knowledge of the Russian revolutionary milieu, and participated in both nihilist and Narodnik conspiracies. Self-exiled to Switzerland, he became a member of the International Workingmen's Association. Arbore was mostly active as an international anarchist and a disciple of Mikhail Bakunin, but eventually parted with the latter to create his independent group, the Revolutionary Community. He was subsequently close to the anarchist geographer Élisée Reclus, who became his new mentor.
Arbore settled in Romania after 1877, and, abandoning anarchism altogether, committed himself to the more moderate cause of socialism. His campaign against Russian despotism also led him to champion the cause of freedom for Bessarabia region, to which he was personally tied by his family history. These commitments resulted in Arbore's outside support for the Russian Revolution of 1905, when he and Petru Cazacu founded the Swiss-based Basarabia newspaper. Arbore had by then earned academic credentials with his detailed works on Bessarabian geography, and, as a cultural journalist, cultivated relationships with socialist and National Liberal activists. He was also notoriously the friend of poet Mihai Eminescu in the 1880s, and worked closely with writer Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu during the 1890s.
During World War I, Zamfir Arbore provoked controversy when he supported a Romanian alliance with the Central Powers, justified in his opinion by a need to liberate Bessarabia. Despite this, and although he publicly welcomed the October Revolution, Arbore was reintegrated into the political scene of Greater Romania, serving two terms in Senate. Before his death in 1933, he was drawn into agrarian and cooperativist politics, and was successively a member of the Peasants' Party and the People's Party. Arbore was survived by his two daughters, both of them famous in their own right: Ecaterina was a communist politician and physician; Nina a modern artist.
Biography
Origins and early life
Zamfir Ralli was the scion of boyar aristocracy from the principality of Moldavia: his paternal grandfather Zamfirache Ralli was an ennobled Greek merchant, married into the local Romanian elite; Zamfir's mother was an ethnic Ukrainian.[2] Although cosmopolitan, the future activist always prioritized his Romanian roots, changing his birth name to Arbore (var. Arbure) in the belief that his Romanian ancestors had inherited the name and boyar status from the ancient Arbore family.[3][4] Zamfirache's son Constantin, the friend of poet Alexander Pushkin, was reputedly adopted by Dimitrie Arbore.[5] He also inherited the Ralli family mansion, a Bessarabian manorial estate in Dolna, which in the 1820s had served as the Pushkin's vacation house.[5][6]
The subsequent genealogical claim traced the family history back to the late 15th century, with Hetman Luca Arbore.[5] It also made Zamfir a distant relative of various members of Romanian socialist environment, including Vasile Morțun and Izabela Sadoveanu.[7] The claim's reliability divides modern researchers. While historian of journalism Victor Frunză sees Arbore as descending "from an ancient family of local boyars",[8] academic Lucian Boia describes Zamfir Arbore as being tied to the historical Arbores by "a rather thin line".[3] Boia also notes that Arbore's "revised past" and arbitrary interpretation of his own background may have been opportunistic, leaving Arbore free to gravitate between conflicting national identities and rendering his radical discourse more palatable for all cultural contexts.[9] According to political scientist Armand Goșu, Arbore had effectively "stolen" his grandmother's maiden name, reviving an otherwise extinct boyar line.[4]
Although mostly active in Bessarabia, Arbore was actually a native of Chernowitz (Romanian: Cernăuți), the administrative center of Bukovina within the Austrian Empire (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine).[6][10] He later moved into Bessarabia (the Russian-ruled Bessarabian Governorate), attending school in Kishinev (Chișinău), before moving to another school in Nikolayev.[6] During his troubled youth, Arbore-Ralli underwent medical training in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but was more involved within the revolutionary, nihilist and pan-Russian anarchist underground, with the goal of subverting Tsarist autocracy.[10][11] His political sympathies also connected him with the Narodnik movement, which he joined at the same time as other young Bessarabian intellectuals (Victor Crăsescu, Axinte Frunză, Constantin Stere, Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu) who saw a link between their nationalist struggle and the agrarian cause of Russian Narodniks[12][13] (he is believed to have been personally acquainted with the agrarian theorist and Narodnik father figure Alexander Herzen).[10]
In Switzerland
The subversive activities brought Zamfir to the attention of Tsarist authorities, particularly after his involvement in Sergey Nechayev's nihilist conspiracy of 1869.[10][14] Unable to finish his studies, Arbore was singled out for arrest, and according to his own account, since placed under doubt,[3] even served time as a political prisoner in the Peter and Paul Fortress and in Siberia.[15][16][17] Eventually, he made his way to Switzerland, where he contacted international anarchist figures such as Mikhail Bakunin and Élisée Reclus.[10][18] Arbore corresponded with the latter for a significant period, sharing his interest in social geography.[10][13][19] His complex relationship with radical exiles also resulted in contacts with anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin[10][20] and the Bulgarian anarchist sympathizer Hristo Botev.[21] He was also, with philosopher Vasile Conta, one of the few intellectuals with a Romanian background to affiliate directly with the International Workingmen's Association (First International), which regrouped the various Marxist and anarchist communities of Europe.[22] In tandem, Arbore was active within Bakunin's Revolutionary Brotherhood, and, according to anarchist historian George Woodcock, one of the "most influential" among the Russian propagators of Bakuninism;[23] political historian James H. Billington also refers to "Zemfiry Ralli" as "Bakunin's principal editor".[24]
Arbore's beliefs led him to join the Jura federation, an anarchist cell within the First International,[10] and to become initiated into Freemasonry (1872).[6] He became strongly opposed to Bakunin's marginalization during the First International's Hague Congress, and signed his name (Z. Ralli) to a letter of protest, alongside Nikolay Ogarev.[25] Also in 1872, Arbore also helped draft the German-language pamphlet which documented Bakunin's condemnation of Nechayev: Ist Netshaejeff ein politischer Verbrecher oder nicht? ("Is Nechayev a Political Felon, or Is He Not?").[26] With Bakunin and Errico Malatesta, he was personally involved in the anarchist agitation sweeping Restoration Spain during the 1870s: he personally helped translate Bakunin's letter to the Iberian anarchists, but their hopes of inciting a new revolution were unsuccessful; progressively after that moment, Arbore and Bakunin grew estranged from one another.[10] According to Woodcock, the reason behind this "personal" rather than ideological conflict was Bakunin's "tactless" support for Arbore's adversary Mikhail Sanzhin, leading Arbore and his partners, the "young Bakuninists", to establish the Revolutionary Community organization.[23] The reasons and objectives of this group, whose other members were Vladimir Holstein, Alexander Oelsnitz and Nikolai Ivanovich Zhukovsky,[23] were outlined in a letter to Jura anarchist James Guillaume.[27]
Moving from Zurich to Geneva, and known primarily as Ralli, Arbore ran a socialist publishing house, through which he helped popularize the political manifestos of anarchism, as well as his own history of the Paris Commune.[10][28] He was among those who established, in 1875, the Genevan Russian-language newspaper Rabotnik ("The Worker"), which bridged the "young Bakuninist" faction with the Eser Party of Vera Figner and Reclus' St. Imier International.[29] One of his colleagues there, future astronomer Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, recalled that Arbore was actively involved in redacting news arriving from Russia, manipulating them for dramatic effect and political conformity.[30] In 1875, he also wrote and published the anarchist tract Sytye i golodnye ("The Sated and the Hungry"), as well as an appeal to Ukrainian peasants in the Russian Empire.[31]
The Swiss period was the start of his new family life. Arbore was by then married, to the Russian Ecaterina Hardina.[32][33] The dowry she brought helped maintain his new publishing venture.[28] His eldest child was daughter Ecaterina Arbore-Ralli, the future communist, feminist and militant physician, born on November 11, 1873, at Bex.[34] His son Dumitru (Mitică) was born on January 11, 1877, in Geneva.[35]
Relocation to Romania
Zamfir Arbore first set foot in Romania during 1873, when he traveled from Geneva to Iași, meeting with the young socialist sympathizer Eugen Lupu.[1] He was later in contact with the Iași Marxist circle of Ioan, Iosif and Sofia Nădejde, sending them books by Karl Marx and his anarchist commentators (Johann Most, Carlo Cafiero).[1] Arbore also established contacts with the socialist cell of Bucharest. He corresponded with some of the Russian socialists who had set up camp there, primarily so with Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu. Together, they set up the Society for Student Culture and Solidarity

Kim Casali (9 September 1941 – 15 June 1997) was a New Zealand cartoonist who created the syndicated cartoon feature Love Is..., originally as love notes to her future husband, in the late 1960s.[1][2][3]
In one of the first cases of its kind, Casali gave birth to a child sixteen months after the death of her husband, having been artificially inseminated using his stored frozen sperm.[4][5][6] The case, which predated the Warnock Report, gave rise to legal discussions regarding the baby's rights of inheritance, and made front-page news across the world.[7] The birth split public opinion and although Casali received "hundreds of letters applauding her bravery", some disagreed with her actions, including the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano which wrote that it was "against evangelical morality."[8][9]
Early career
Born Marilyn Judith Grove in Auckland, New Zealand, Casali left home aged nineteen to travel around Australia, Europe and the United States. In 1967 she moved to Los Angeles where she met and began a relationship with Roberto Alfredo Vincenzo Casali, an Italian computer engineer, at a ski-club where they were both taking lessons.[10][11] Casali had been drawing cartoons of humorous incidents on the ski slopes, which Roberto encouraged, and she soon began adding cartoon illustrations to messages which she left for him. 
The very first drawing was created as a "signature" to a note, and represented Casali herself with freckles, large eyes and long fair hair. She said later of these cartoons: "I began making little drawings to express how I felt... It was a little bit like keeping a diary that described how my feelings had grown."[2][10] In the September 1981 Cartoonist Profiles magazine she said: "I drew a round blob of a girl who was supposed to be me, the one who was feeling all these fantastic things. Then I added a blob of a boy who was the reason I was feeling these things."[10]
Syndication and success
Fourth edition print of one of the many LOVE IS.... books written and drawn by Kim Grove, published by Signette. The frontispiece carries the message “FOR MY MOTHER”.
Casali's obituary published in The Times related that after she and Roberto became engaged, Casali took a job as a receptionist for a design company, "and made up little booklets of her winsome cartoons, which she sold for a dollar apiece. Word soon spread and the demand for Love is... escalated. Roberto recognised their commercial potential and showed them to an American journalist."[6] Although other sources differ regarding whether it was Roberto or Casali herself who first showed the cartoons to an acquaintance working for the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper picked them up for publication and published the first of the series on 5 January 1970, under the pen name "Kim".[2][10][12][13] The cartoon's release coincided with the wave of success of the novel Love Story (1970) by Erich Segal, and the subsequent movie of the same name starring Ali MacGraw as a girl dying of an incurable disease and Ryan O'Neal as the student who worshiped her. The film's slogan was "Love means never having to say you're sorry." Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: "Love is... being able to say you're sorry."[14]
While the cartoons proved to be very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple "found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us one step ahead of the Immigration Department'".[2][10] By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936.[2][13] Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon.[11] At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, the cartoons were earning Casali £4–5 million annually.[6]
Bereavement and 'miracle' baby
By 1974 the couple had two sons, Stefano and Dario, and planned to have two more children.[5] In 1975 Roberto was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Casali commissioned London-based English cartoonist Bill Asprey to take over the writing and drawing of the daily cartoons for her, under her signature.[15] Asprey has produced the cartoon continuously since 1975.[16]
Roberto opted for surgery at the end of 1975 in order to prolong his life.[10] Casali said: "We were talking about Christmas presents and I told Roberto I didn't want another diamond ring, I wanted another baby."[6] They decided "...that we would store some sperm just in case I didn't get pregnant before Roberto died. I knew he had only a few months to live, so we stored some sperm immediately." Roberto died in March 1976, aged 31. Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977.[6][8][17] She said at the time: "Roberto and I were very anxious to provide a brother or sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made possible for me to have another reminder of my wonderful husband."[4] British newspapers called Milo the "miracle baby".[17] The birth announcement consisted of a simple card drawn by Casali with the Love is... girl pushing a pram on the front, with the inscription inside: "Proudly presenting Milo Roberto. Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)".[18]
Later life
In the mid-1980s Casali moved the family to New South Wales, Australia, and bought a farm north of Sydney where she bred Arabian horses for several years. In 1990 she returned to England and settled in Leatherhead, Surrey.[6][7] In 1996 Diane Blood, a widow, sought impregnation with her husband's sperm, and Casali gave a rare interview in which she "deplored the courts' involvement in Mrs Blood's case: such matters, she said, should be dealt with privately."[7] Casali died due to cancer of the bone and liver in 1997.[19]

Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالي, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli];[5] born 15 June 1992), known as Mohamed Salah or Mo Salah, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a right winger or forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation and among the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.[6][7][8]
Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon Al Arab, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017, Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9 million. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League final. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané after the departure of Philippe Coutinho, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes in the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup, EFL Cup and FA Community Shield. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021, and finished fifth in the 2019 and 2022 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for his winning strike in the first Merseyside derby of the 2017–18 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's top Premier League goalscorer, and became the fifth player to score 200 goals for the club.
At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.
Salah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his achievements[9][10] and was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in 2019.[11] Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among Egyptians.[12][13] To Egyptians, Salah is known as the "Fourth Pyramid".[14][15] Favoured across the Arab world, Salah is often known as the "Pride of the Arabs".[16][17]
Salah started out playing for the youth setups of local teams Ittihad Basyoun and Othmason Tanta.[18] He names Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti as his childhood idols.[19] In 2006, he joined the youth team of Al Mokawloon Al Arab aged 14 after being spotted by a scout who had originally come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.[20][21] Salah frequently had to miss school to make the three-hour journey to training.[19] When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first-team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the first-team squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age.[22]
Salah made his first-team debut on 3 May 2010 in the Egyptian Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 away draw against El Mansoura.[citation needed] During the 2010–11 season Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.[20] Even though he was getting regular game time, Salah struggled to score. In the dressing room after matches he would sometimes be in tears because of this, and Radwan says it only motivated him to become better.[21] He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against Al Ahly.[23] He remained a regular for Al Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011–12 season.[24][25] Following the Port Said Stadium riot on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March, the Egyptian Football Association announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.[26]
Salah playing for Basel away at Zenit St Petersburg in the UEFA Europa League in March 2013
Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time,[27] so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt national under-23 team.[28] The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.[29] Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.[30][31][32] He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for Xherdan Shaqiri.[33] Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against FCSB during a friendly match, a 4–2 defeat.[34] He made his official Basel debut in a UEFA Champions League preliminary stage match against the Norwegian club Molde on 8 August, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute.[35] He made his league debut on 12 August against Thun, playing the full match.[36]
He scored his first league goal a week later, the second goal in the 2–0 home win against Lausanne-Sport.[37] Salah scored his first UEFA Europa League goal in the quarter-finals on 11 April 2013, as Basel advanced to the semi-finals by beating Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 4–4 aggregate draw.[38] In the semi-final on 2 May, Salah scored away to Chelsea, although Basel were beaten 5–2 on aggregate.[39] Despite late disappointment in Europe, Basel won the 2012–13 Swiss Super League title[40] and finished runners-up in the Swiss Cup.[41]
Ahead of the 2013–14 Swiss Super League season, Salah was a member of the Basel team that won the 2013 Uhrencup.[42] Salah scored in his first league appearance of the season against Aarau on 13 July 2013.[43] He scored his first Champions League goal a month later against Maccabi Tel Aviv on 6 August 2013 in the third qualifying round.[44] Salah was the subject of major controversy following the game, after he appeared to deliberately avoid shaking hands with the players of the Israeli club in both the home and away legs.[45]
He scored twice against the Bulgarian league champions PFC Ludogorets Razgrad on 21 August 2013 in the play-off round.[46] On 18 September 2013, Salah scored the equaliser against Chelsea in the 2–1 away win during the group stage. During the return tie on 26 November at the St. Jakob-Park, Salah scored the winning goal as Basel beat Chelsea for the second time with a 1–0 home win.[47] However he was unable to prevent Basel being eliminated in the group stage.[48]
On the domestic stage, Salah continued to perform. Scoring 4 goals in 18 games,[49] including a double against title rivals Young Boys,[50] he helped Basel win the league title for the fifth time in a row.[51]
On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Salah would leave Basel.[52] During his time with the club, Salah played a total of 95 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 47 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, six in the Swiss Cup, 26 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 16 were friendly games. He scored nine goals in the domestic league, four in the cup, seven in the European games and the other was scored during the test games.[53]
On 23 January 2014, Premier League club Chelsea announced that a deal had been agreed with Basel to sign Salah for a fee reported to be in the region of £11 million.[54] Three days later the transfer was completed, making him the first Egyptian to sign for the London-based club.[55] Liverpool had been interested in Salah, and had made an offer of £11 million but were beaten to his signature by Chelsea.[56]
On 8 February, Salah made his debut for Chelsea in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in the 3–0 win over Newcastle United.[57] Seven games later, on 22 March, Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against Arsenal in the London Derby, coming on as a substitute for Oscar, in a match which ended as a 6–0 home win.[58] Then, on 5 April, Salah opened the scoring and later won a penalty and assisted the third goal in Chelsea's 3–0 win over Stoke City.[59]
Before the 2014–15 season, Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in doubt after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.[60] He was spared of military service after a meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education, and the Egypt national team manager Shawky Gharieb.[61] Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by Eden Hazard changing to number 10.[62]
Salah was rarely used during the season, making just three Premier League, two Champions League and three cup appearances, failing to score in any of them. On 28 October 2014, after a poor performance in a 2–1 win away League Two team Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup, he and fellow winger André Schürrle were criticised publicly by manager José Mourinho.[63] Although Salah only made three league appearances before his loan move to Fiorentina, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner's medal from the club for his contributions that season.[64]

Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán[1] (Spanish: [ˈkaɾlos umˈbeɾto sanˈtana βaraˈɣan] ⓘ; born July 20, 1947) is an American guitarist, best known as a founding member of the rock band Santana. Born and raised in Mexico where he developed his musical background, he rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States with Santana, which pioneered a fusion of rock and roll and Latin American jazz. Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s.
In 2015, Rolling Stone magazine listed Santana at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists.[3] In 2023, Rolling Stone named him the 11th greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards,[5] and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.[6]
Biography
Early life
Santana was born in Autlán de Navarro in Jalisco, Mexico on July 20, 1947. He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight, under the tutelage of his father, who was a mariachi musician.[7] His younger brother, Jorge, also became a professional guitarist.
The family moved from Autlán to Tijuana, on the border with the United States. Carlos' rock and roll career started in the city park: Parque Teniente Guerrero, his mother took him to see the Tj's, the pioneer rock and roll band from the city. TJ (tee jay) is a nickname for Tijuana. They were formed by Javier Bátiz. At the age of 12 Carlos became a roadie and eventually he would join them as a bass player, bass because Bátiz was playing guitar. He later left so he could play guitar in another bar band.[8] The Tj's and Bátiz turned Carlos onto Blues. Specially into T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, and James Brown.
The Santanas then moved to San Francisco where his father had steady work.[7][9][10][11] In October 1966, Santana started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. Santana later said, "If I would go to some cat's room, he'd be listening to Sly [Stone] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles. Another guy'd be listening to Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaría. Another guy'd be listening to Miles [Davis] and [John] Coltrane... to me, it was like being at a university."[12]
Around the age of eight, Santana "fell under the influence" of blues performers like B.B. King, Javier Bátiz, Mike Bloomfield, and John Lee Hooker. Gábor Szabó's mid-1960s jazz guitar work also strongly influenced Santana's playing. Indeed, Szabó's composition "Gypsy Queen" was used as the second part of Santana's 1970 treatment of Peter Green's composition "Black Magic Woman", almost down to identical guitar licks. Santana's 2012 instrumental album Shape Shifter includes a song called "Mr. Szabo", played in tribute in the style of Szabó. Santana also credits Hendrix, Bloomfield, Hank Marvin, and Peter Green as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a 2000 biography of Bloomfield, Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues – An Oral History.[13] Between the ages of 10 and 12, he was sexually abused by an American man who brought him across the border.[14] Santana lived in the Mission District, graduated from James Lick Middle School, and left Mission High School in 1965. He was accepted at California State University, Northridge and Humboldt State University, but chose not to attend college.[15]
Early career
"The '60s were a leap in human consciousness. Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Che Guevara, Mother Teresa, they led a revolution of conscience. The Beatles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix created revolution and evolution themes. The music was like Dalí, with many colors and revolutionary ways. The youth of today must go there to find themselves."
Santana was influenced by popular artists of the 1950s such as B.B. King, T-Bone Walker, Javier Batiz,[17] and John Lee Hooker.[18] Soon after he began playing guitar, he joined local bands along the "Tijuana Strip" where he was able to begin developing his own sound.[18] He was also introduced to a variety of new musical influences, including jazz and folk music, and witnessed the growing hippie movement centered in San Francisco in the 1960s. After several years spent working as a dishwasher at Tic Tock Drive-In No2 and busking to pay for a Gibson SG, replacing a destroyed Gibson Melody Maker,[19] Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966, he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated Paul Butterfield set to play a Sunday matinee at Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the Butterfield Blues Band, Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane. Santana's guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and Graham.[20]
During the same year he and fellow street musicians David Brown (bass guitar), Marcus Malone (percussion) and Gregg Rolie (lead vocals, Hammond Organ B3), formed the Santana Blues Band.[21]
Record deal, Woodstock breakthrough, and height of success: 1969–1972
Santana's band was signed by Columbia Records, which shortened its name to simply "Santana".[22] It went into the studio to record its first album in January 1969, finally laying down tracks in May that became its first album. Members were not satisfied with the release, dismissed drummer Bob Livingston, and added Mike Shrieve, who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Then the band lost percussionist Marcus Malone, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Michael Carabello was re-enlisted in his place, bringing with him experienced Nicaraguan percussionist José Chepito Areas.
Major rock music promoter Bill Graham, a Latin Music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception, arranged for the band to appear at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival, highlighted by an eleven-minute performance of a throbbing instrumental, "Soul Sacrifice". Its inclusion in the Woodstock film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band's popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the Willie Bobo song "Evil Ways", as he felt it would get radio airplay. The band's first album, Santana, was released in August 1969 and became a hit, reaching No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200.[23]
The band's performance at Woodstock and the follow-up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim. The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic hard rock sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music. He became fascinated with Gábor Szabó, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, and John Coltrane, as well as developing a growing interest in spirituality. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal brain hemorrhage, and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first Willie Bobo, then Coke Escovedo), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed and the band started to disintegrate.
Consolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, Abraxas, in September 1970. The album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band's early sound. Abraxas included two of Santana's most enduring and well-known hits, "Oye Como Va", and "Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen". Abraxas spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970.[24] The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4× platinum in 1986.[25] In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[26]
Teenage San Francisco Bay Area guitar prodigy Neal Schon joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, Santana III. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band's sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group Tower of Power's horn section, Luis Gasca of Malo, and other session musicians which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. Santana III was another success, reaching No. 1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hit "No One to Depend On".
Tension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru due to unruly fans and student protests against U.S. governmental policies.

Matthew Jack Leach (born 22 June 1991) is an English professional cricketer who plays internationally for the England Test cricket team. In domestic cricket, he represents Somerset.[3] Leach made his Test debut in 2018.[3] He plays as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler.[3]
Early life and education
Leach was born in Taunton, England on 22 June 1991, and attended Trinity School, Bishop Fox's School and Richard Huish College all in Taunton.[4] He used to be employed to park trolleys at a branch of Sainsbury's supermarket in Taunton.[5] At the age of 14, Leach was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.[6][7]
Cricket career
Leach graduated from the Somerset County Cricket Club academy in the summer of 2010,[8] prior to signing a professional contract with Somerset. Leach represented Dorset County Cricket Club in the 2010 Minor Counties Cricket Championship, and bowled his side to victory in the final against Lincolnshire taking 6/21 in their second innings.[9] Leach completed his degree at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff in sports coaching.[1] Whilst attending university Leach represented Cardiff MCCU in 2011 and 2012 making his first-class debut against his county side Somerset in March 2012, bowling 41 overs but failing to take a wicket as Somerset amassed 642/3d.[10]
Leach made his Somerset debut in a two-day match against the touring South Africans in July 2012, claiming the prized wicket of Hashim Amla.[11] He made his first-class debut for Somerset in the 2012 County Championship match against Lancashire in August 2012,[12] the rain affected match finished as a draw with Leach claiming Kyle Hogg as his maiden first-class wicket.[13] Further opportunities in the first team were limited for the rest of the 2012 season with the signing of Pakistani spinner Abdur Rehman, and Leach only featured in one further County Championship match and three matches in the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40, but ended the season ninth in the national first-class averages with 12 wickets at 18.83 runs apiece.[14] Leach spent the 2012–13 winter playing grade cricket for Valley District Cricket Club in Brisbane, Australia, helping his side to win the T20 competition.[15]
Leach returned to Somerset for pre-season on a summer contract and played his first Championship game of the season against Warwickshire due to an injury to first choice spinner George Dockrell; he took his maiden five-wicket haul in the second innings, with 24 of his 44 overs being maidens.[5][16] Leach made his Twenty20 debut on 23 June 2021, for Somerset in the 2021 T20 Blast.[17]
In April 2022, he was bought by the Birmingham Phoenix for the 2022 season of The Hundred.[18]
International career
On 14 February 2018, while playing for the England Lions against West Indies A, Leach achieved match figures of 8–110; in doing so, he beat the previous best figures by an England Lions spinner (Graeme Swann's 8–156).[19]
2018–21: Sporadic appearances
On 16 March 2018, he was called up to England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand as an injury replacement for Mason Crane.[20] He made his debut in the second Test in Christchurch.[21]
After losing his place to Adil Rashid and then Moeen Ali in the 2018 home summer, Leach was recalled for the winter tour of Sri Lanka. In an unusual circumstance, with one over left to play in the day during the second test, Leach opened England's innings as a nightwatchman, surviving till stumps. He was dismissed for 1 off 11 balls the next morning.[22] He did not play in England's subsequent tour of the West Indies but returned for the one-off Test against Ireland. Leach was once again the nightwatchman for England, batting for a single over at the close of day one.[23] England won the Test by 143 runs, with Leach scoring 92 runs, which earned him the man of the match award.[24]
After Ali was preferred for the first 2019 Ashes test, Leach was then recalled for the second Ashes test at Lords, on 14 August 2019, where he scored 6 not out in the first innings and took 1-19 and 3–37 in Australia's first and second innings respectively. England drew the match. Leach scored one run, tying the game, in a partnership of 76 with Ben Stokes, to help England win the third Ashes test at Headingley, by one wicket. It has been described as "arguably the greatest one not out in the history of the game".[25] Leach gained a cult following over the summer of 2019, with his glasses being a contributing factor. He regularly cleans them through his innings, and has received free Specsavers glasses for life following his heroics supporting Ben Stokes in the dramatic Headingley test.[26] This cult reputation was enhanced by his behaviour off the pitch, such as leading some of the England team out to recreate his famous run at Headingley after the match.[27] Leach played the rest of the series including a pivotal role in the final test, bowling England to victory with figures of 4–49.[28]
Over the 2019–20 winter, Leach only played one of England's six tests: he was not selected for the second test against New Zealand, England opting to play an extra seam bowler instead;[29] he missed the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy due to illness.[30]
On 29 May 2020, Leach was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic.[31][32] On 17 June 2020, Leach was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies.[33][34] However, Dominic Bess was preferred for the 2020 home summer.[35][36]
Leach returned to the team for the winter tours against Sri Lanka and the Anthony De Mello Trophy. Therein he took 28 wickets across the six tests,[37][38] but did not retain his place for the summer; England instead opting not to use a spinner against New Zealand and then preferring Moeen Ali for the Pataudi Trophy.
2021–present: First choice spinner
Following the sudden retirement of Ali, Leach was included in the 2021–22 Ashes series squad and was selected ahead of Stuart Broad for the first test at The Gabba despite the pitch being a "green top" which favoured the seamers. He returned match figures of 1–102 with an economy rate of 7.84, one of the worst innings economy rates in history.[39] He was in and out of the team for the rest of the series - England choosing not to play him when a pink ball was in use - but improved through the series and finished with six wickets at an average of 53.50.[40] He played all three Tests in the inaugural Richards–Botham Trophy and finished joint leading wicket taker in the series with Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales as England lost the series 1–0.[41] He also scored 41 not out in the final test but it was not enough to prevent defeat.
Following the ascendency of Ben Stokes to the captaincy Leach was given a more senior role in the side, playing every test match for which he was available. Despite being ruled out of the first test against New Zealand due to a concussion sustained whilst fielding,[42] he returned for the next test, and in the final test of the series he recorded his first ten-wicket haul in Tests with 10–166 in the match. He was less prolific against South Africa, as the low-scoring nature of the series meant he was often not required to bowl, but in the 2022–23 winter he took 25 wickets across five tests against Pakistan and New Zealand, including a five-wicket haul in Wellington.
The media, and Leach himself, have praised Stokes's handling of Leach.[43][44] Notably, Stokes has kept attacking fields for Leach even when batters have looked to attack him.[45] Leach ended 2022 as the third-highest wicket-taker in the world, behind only Kagiso Rabada and Nathan Lyon.[46]
After feeling a pain in his back during the first Test match of the 2023 summer, Leach was ruled out of the subsequent Ashes series with a lower back stress fracture.[47]

Chadwick Aaron Boseman (/ˈboʊzmən/;[5] November 29, 1976[a] – August 28, 2020) was an American actor. During his two-decade career, Boseman received several accolades, including two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award, along with an Academy Award nomination.
Born in South Carolina, Boseman studied directing at Howard University and began his career in theatre. Boseman won a Drama League Directing Fellowship and an acting AUDELCO, along with receiving a Jeff Award nomination for his 2005 play Deep Azure. Transitioning to the screen, his first major role was as a series regular on the NBC drama Persons Unknown (2010) and he landed his breakthrough role as baseball player Jackie Robinson in 42 (2013). He continued to portray historical figures, starring as singer James Brown in Get on Up (2014) and as Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017).
Boseman achieved international fame for playing the Marvel Comics superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) from 2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an eponymous 2018 film that earned him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. As the first Black actor to headline an MCU film, he was also named in the 2018 Time 100. Boseman's final performance as the character in the Disney+ anthology series What If...? (2021) earned him a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance.
In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. He kept his condition private, continuing to act until his death in 2020 from the illness. His final film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim, earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. Boseman also received four nominations at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work in Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the most for a performer at a single ceremony,[6] winning Male Actor in a Leading Role for the latter.
Chadwick Aaron Boseman[7][8] was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina,[9][10][11] the son of Carolyn (née Mattress)[12][13] and Leroy Boseman, both African-American.[14] His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a textile factory and managed an upholstery business.[15] In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts,[16] and continued this training as an adult.[17] As a child, he wanted to become an architect.[18] According to Boseman, DNA testing indicated that some of his ancestors were Jola people from Guinea-Bissau,[19] Krio people and Limba people from Sierra Leone, and Yoruba people from Nigeria.[20]
Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995, where he played on the basketball team.[21][22] In his junior year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed.[15] He competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original Oratory at the 1995 National Tournament.[23] He was recruited to play basketball at college but chose the arts instead,[24] attending college at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in directing.[25] While at Howard, he worked in an African American–oriented bookstore near the university, which friend Vanessa German said was important and inspirational to him;[16] he drew on his experience there for his play Hieroglyphic Graffiti.[26]
His teachers at Howard included Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor.[26][15] Rashad helped raise funds, notably from her friend and prominent actor Denzel Washington,[8] so that Boseman and other classmates could attend the Oxford Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy at Balliol College, Oxford, in England, to which they had been accepted.[15][27] Boseman wanted to write and direct, and initially began studying acting to learn how to relate to actors.[28] He attended the program in 1998, and he developed an appreciation for the playwriting of William Shakespeare;[16] additionally, he studied the works of various dramatists, including Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter.[26] He also traveled to Africa for the first time while at college, working in Ghana with his professor Mike Malone "to preserve and celebrate rituals with performances on a proscenium stage"; he said it was "one of the most significant learning experiences of [his] life".[29] After he returned to the U.S., he took additional course work in film studies, graduating from New York City's Digital Film Academy.[30][31]
Boseman lived in Brooklyn, New York City, at the start of his career.[15] In 2000, he was named a Drama League Directing Fellow. He directed productions including George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum[24][32] (Wolfe would later direct Boseman in his final role)[33] and a staging of Amiri Baraka's Dutchman.[24] He worked as the drama instructor in the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem between 2002 and 2009.[7][34]
He rose to prominence as a playwright and stage actor in 2002, performing in multiple productions and winning an AUDELCO award in 2002 for his part in Ron Milner's Urban Transitions.[24] As a member of the National Shakespeare Company of New York, he played Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Malcolm in Macbeth.[35] He directed and wrote plays[36][37] as part of the Hip-hop theater movement; his works included Rhyme Deferred (co-written with Howard classmate Kamilah Forbes), in which he also performed, and Hieroglyphic Graffiti.[24][38][39][40] Rhyme Deferred was commissioned for a national tour, as well as featuring in The Fire This Time anthology of works, while Hieroglyphic Graffiti was produced at a variety of locations, including the National Black Theatre Festival in 2001.[24] Combining modern African-American culture and Egyptian deities, it is set in Washington, D.C. and was picked up by the New York Hip-Hop Theatre Festival and Tennessee State University's summer stock theatre program in 2002.[41] It was also the Kuntu Repertory Theatre's 2002–03 season launch production. At the 2002 Hip-Hop Theatre Festival, Boseman also gave a one-man show called "Red Clay and Carved Concrete".[35]
In 2003, Boseman was cast in his first television role, an episode of Third Watch,[42] and began playing Reggie Montgomery in the daytime soap opera All My Children.[43] He was fired from All My Children after voicing concerns to producers about racist stereotypes in the script; the role was subsequently re-cast, with Boseman's future Black Panther co-star Michael B. Jordan taking the part.[44][45] Boseman had wanted to work around the stereotypes of the character, feeling that being in a soap opera would give him more room for improvisation as the writers often do not initially plan a full story;[46] his (then-future) agent said that when Boseman was given the second script and learned that his character's parents were a drug addict and an absent father, Boseman confronted the creators.[45] He reflected on the experience in his 2018 commencement address to Howard University, saying that it "seemed to be wrapped up in assumptions about us as black folks [and he] would have to make something out of nothing."[46] His other early television work included episodes of the series Law & Order, Cold Case, CSI: NY, and ER.[7]
Boseman's best-known play, Deep Azure, was commissioned in 2004 by the Congo Square Theatre Company in Chicago. It was nominated for a 2006 Jeff Award for Best New Work.[38][24] Boseman said at the time that Deep Azure was "a fusion and progression of [his] previous plays", which he did not feel fit wholly in the Hip Hop theater genre.[24] The play – about police brutality, a daring subject in 2004, and largely delivered in rhyme – was workshopped at the Apollo Theater in New York.[47][48] Drama critic Chris Jones in the Chicago Tribune highly praised the work.[47] In 2008, Boseman turned Deep Azure into a screenplay. Michael Greene, who would become his agent, picked it up and contacted Boseman when Tessa Thompson and Omari Hardwick expressed an interest in playing the lead roles, prompting Boseman's move to Los Angeles.[45] He also directed, wrote, and produced the short film Blood Over a Broken Pawn in 2007, which was honored at the 2008 Hollywood Black Film Festival.[38][49]
In 2008, Boseman moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film and acting career.[27]  He was cast in a recurring role on the television series Lincoln Heights as Nathaniel Ray Taylor, an army veteran with PTSD who was later revealed to be the son of the main character before re-enlisting.[50] He also appeared in his first feature film in 2008, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, as running back Floyd Little.[51] He landed his first regular role in the 2010 television series Persons Unknown as the Marine Graham McNair.[52] The show received mediocre reviews that felt the characters were all archetypes with little development.[53][54] In July 2013, Boseman's second short film as director, Heaven, premiered at the HollyShorts Film Festival.[55]

Boseman's breakthrough role came in 2013 with the film 42, in which he portrayed the lead role of baseball legend Jackie Robinson.[51][56] Boseman had been directing an off-Broadway play in the East Village when he auditioned for the role,[57] and was considering giving up acting to pursue directing full-time.[58] About twenty-five other actors had been seriously considered for the role, but director Brian Helgeland liked Boseman's bravery in choosing to read the most difficult scene, in which Robinson goes down a stadium tunnel and breaks a bat in anger, and cast him after he had auditioned twice.[59][25][60] Part of the audition process involved playing baseball; Boseman had been involved with Little League as a child but was primarily a basketball player growing up, saying that in this part the casting directors likely noticed his athleticism rather than specifically baseball skills.[57] Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinso

Regina Martínez Pérez (7 September 1963 – 28 April 2012) was a Mexican journalist and veteran crime reporter for Proceso, a center-left Mexican news magazine known for its critical reporting of the social and political establishment.
Born in a small town in the state of Veracruz, Martínez Pérez left her hometown to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of censorship that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Martínez Pérez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Martínez Pérez faced several challenges of censorship by the political establishment for her direct reporting, and particularly for being an outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse of authority, and for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.
Early in the morning of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being severely beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. However, the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, and several journalists and press freedom organizations have complained about irregularities in the investigation and question the legitimacy of the whole case. They believe that their colleague's murder was part of a campaign of intimidation against those who investigate alleged links between drug traffickers and politicians in the state of Veracruz.
Early life
Regina Martínez Pérez was born in the small town of Rafael Lucio, Veracruz on 7 September 1963. Her parents, María Lorenza Pérez Vázquez and Florencio Martínez Romero, had 11 children. From a young age, Martínez Pérez wanted to be a journalist; after graduating from high school, she left her hometown to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana (UV). Shortly after graduating, she moved to the state of Chiapas to work as a reporter for Mexican Rural Television (Televisión Rural Mexicana – TRM), a state-owned television company, in the early 1980s. Martínez Pérez was part of a group of former students from the UV who were hired by the government to work at the television company. But after demanding better working conditions and facing censorship from the company, she left the company to pursue a career in print media.[1][2][3]
Career
Martínez Pérez worked for several newspapers in Chiapas, like El Sol de Chiapas and Número Uno, for five years before she returned to her home state of Veracruz, where she became the editorial assistant of the news channel Cuatro Más. The journalist then left to work for the daily Política, where she covered topics on security and social justice.[4][5] Martínez Pérez was also a journalist and investigative crime reporter  for the Diario de Xalapa newspaper.[1][6] Her journalistic career in Veracruz, however, faced several challenges from the political elite; governors and government secretaries wanted to censor Martínez Pérez for criticizing their administration. Instead of self-censoring like other media outlets in the state, she became known for her direct reporting style, which frequently angered the authorities. She wrote over 63 reports covering political assassinations, natural disasters, authority abuses, human right violations, corruption, and government mismanagement.[1][7]
After working for the Diario de Xalapa, Martínez Pérez became a local correspondent for the newspaper La Jornada in the state and later joined the news magazine Proceso, where she worked for more than ten years.[4][5][8] The news magazine is well known for having an "anti-establishment publication" style, and often runs articles that criticize politicians across the country. Many of its reporters have been threatened in the past for their journalistic coverage.[8]
In Proceso, Martínez Pérez was an open critic of government corruption and abuse of authority, and wrote extensively on the local drug trade and organized crime.[4][9] She was particularly known in Mexico for her in-depth reporting on the Mexican drug cartels and how they corrupted government officials in Veracruz.[10] Among her last publications before her murder was a political profile about Reynaldo Escobar Pérez and Alejandro Montano, two politicians of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who were running for office in Congress.[5]  A week before her murder she had also written about an incident in which the Mexican Navy arrested nine policemen in the state who were allegedly working for a drug trafficking organization,[11] the arrest of a high-profile leader of Los Zetas drug cartel known as Comandante Chaparro,[12]  and a story involving mayor Martín Padua Zúñiga from the National Action Party (PAN) who was arrested with drug traffickers following a gunfight with the Mexican Army.[6][10][13]
Death
Mexico CityXalapaclass=notpageimage| Mentioned locations within Mexico relative to the capital Mexico City.
Martínez Pérez was murdered early in the morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz.[4] When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor.[14] According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death.[10] The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation.[15] At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.[10][14]
In October 2012, new details emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), two men who were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez.[16][17] Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the reporter knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house on the night of her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to overpower her as she only weighed 108 lbs (48.9 kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.[16][17]
Investigation
When Silva was arrested in October 2012, he confessed to the murder of Martínez Pérez. Investigators and authorities in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery.[18] When placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member.[19][20] During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records.[20] Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder.[20][21] According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.[20]
Six months after Martínez Pérez's slaying, the Veracruz authorities stated that her murder was also a crime of passion. According to the reports, Domínguez was the alleged boyfriend of the journalist.[22][23] In April 2013, Proceso stated that it had received classified information that its senior editor who was covering the investigation, Jorge Carrasco, was a possible target by corrupt Veracruz officials. Reportedly, members of the administration of Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa were allowed to carry out "hostile actions against the reporter in response to his most recent publication on the Regina Martínez case."[22] Sources close to the news magazine alleged that officials were plotting to kill the reporter while he was in the nation's capital, Mexico City. The Veracruz authorities responded by stating that the accusations were false and asked Proceso to provide evidence for its claims.[22] The governor promised that he would investigate the threats, and the journalist went into hiding with several armed bodyguards.[16] That same month, Silva was sentenced to 38 years and 2 months in prison for the murder. The judge also ordered the murderer to pay roughly US$8,000 in reparations for her death and the stolen possessions. Proceso, however, expressed its doubt on the murder case and trial once again, stating that they did not believe the court was sentencing the right man.[24][25]
Many journalists continue to dispute the facts in the case, believing that the murder was retribution for reports by Martínez Pérez on drug trafficking and political corruption; they have questioned the investigation by the state of Veracruz.[20][26][27] Proceso magazine's reporter said the investigators never explored the possibility that her journalism may have been the motive behind her murder.[21] Press freedom organizations across the world have complained that the case was designed to cover up the crime instead of clarifying what actually happened.[16] "We don't believe them [the authorities]", said Proceso reporter Jorge Carrasco on behalf of the whole newspaper magazine.[20] The case was the subject of a podcast [28] by A Safer World for Truth and openDemocracy released in December 2021.

Rob Furlong (born 11 November 1976) is a Canadian former military sniper who, from March 2002 until November 2009, held the world record for the longest confirmed sniper kill in combat, at 2,430 m (2,657 yd).[1] His record stood for over 7 years until surpassed by British soldier Craig Harrison with a distance of 2,475 m (2,707 yd).
Early life
Born on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, on 11 November 1976. In his early life Furlong taught himself to fire a rifle ambidextrously.[1]
Military career
Inspired by a VHS tape, Furlong decided to join the military in 1997. Furlong enlisted in the Canadian Army and served with the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Furlong was stationed in Bosnia in 1999 as a peace keeper.[2]
In March 2002, Furlong participated in Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan's Shah-i-Kot Valley. His sniper team included Master Corporal Graham Ragsdale (Team Commander), Master Corporal Tim McMeekin, Master Corporal Arron Perry, and Corporal Dennis Eason. A group of three Al-Qaeda fighters was moving into a mountainside position when Furlong took aim with his long-range sniper weapon (LRSW), a .50-calibre McMillan Brothers Tac-50 rifle, loaded with Hornady A-MAX 750 gr very-low-drag bullets. He began firing at a fighter carrying an RPK machine gun. Furlong's first shot missed and his second shot hit the knapsack on the target's back. The third struck the target's torso, killing him. The distance was measured as 2,430 metres (2,657 yd). With a muzzle speed of 823 metres per second (2,700 ft/s), each shot reached the target almost three seconds after Furlong fired. This became the longest sniper kill in history at the time, surpassing the previous record set by his teammate, Master Corporal Arron Perry, by 120 metres (130 yd).[3]
This feat is not typical for the effective range with a high first-hit probability of the employed rifle on non-static targets (see maximum effective range). The shot was aided by the ambient air density in the Shah-i-Kot Valley where Furlong operated, which is significantly lower than at sea level due to its 2,700 metres (9,000 ft) mean elevation.[original research?]
In December 2003, PPCLI snipers Master Corporal Graham Ragsdale, Master Corporal Tim McMeekin, Corporal Dennis Eason, Corporal Rob Furlong and Master Corporal Arron Perry were awarded the Bronze Star Medal by the United States Army for their actions in combat during Operation Anaconda from 2–11 March 2002. Furlong held the record of longest kill shot recorded in history until November 2009,[4] when his record of 2,430 metres (2,657 yd) was beaten by British Army soldier Craig Harrison, who set a new record by shooting two Taliban fighters at 2,475 metres (2,707 yd).[3]
Later career
After leaving the Canadian Army, Furlong moved to Edmonton, Alberta and joined the Edmonton Police Service in 2004. In 2012, Furlong was dismissed from the police for discreditable conduct, after an episode in which he physically abused and urinated on a fellow police officer.[5][6] In 2013, he opened a marksmanship academy, Rob Furlong's Marksmanship Academy, headquartered in Edmonton.[7]

Alberto Malesani (Italian pronunciation: [alˈbɛrto maleˈzaːni]; born 5 June 1954) is an Italian football manager and former player. As a manager, he is mostly remembered for his successful spell with Parma during the late 1990s, with whom they won the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup, and the Supercoppa Italiana.
Career
Early career and breakthrough at Chievo
Malesani career as player was mostly spent on a Veronese amateur team Audace S. Michele, where he obtained a promotion from Serie D to Serie C in 1976–77, appearing fourteen times on that season.[1] He retired from playing football at the age of 24, and worked at Canon in Amsterdam, where he studied the Ajax Amsterdam total football training methods.[2] His passion for coaching was so great, that on his honeymoon, he decided to go to Barcelona in order to watch Johan Cruyff's coaching sessions at FC Barcelona.
Malesani left his job at Canon in 1990 order to pursue a coaching career at Serie C1 team Chievo for the Allievi youth squad. In 1991, he is assistant of head coach Carlo De Angelis in the first team, and in 1993 he becomes head coach himself. His first season as head coach ended in a historical promotion to Serie B for then-unknown Chievo.
Fiorentina, Parma and UEFA Cup triumph
Malesani left Chievo in 1997, after three Serie B seasons and a narrowly missed promotion in the Serie A league in order to become Fiorentina's boss, in what was his first stint in the Italian top flight.
A good Fiorentina season convinced Parma to appoint Malesani as new head coach in 1998, where he won a Coppa Italia, a UEFA Cup, an Italian Super Cup and obtained two fourth places before being sacked during the 2000–01 season.[3][4]
From Verona to Panathinaikos and Udinese
After losing his job at Parma, Malesani then coached Verona[5] and Modena, failing to save the clubs from relegation in both cases; successively he moved abroad to coach Greek side Panathinaikos. Panathinaikos remains the club with the highest percentage of wins in Malesani's career to date (60%).
Malesani was appointed coach of Udinese in January 2007, as replacement for Giovanni Galeone. He led his side to tenth place in the 2006–07 Serie A final table, only seven points far from relegation, being not confirmed for the following season. On 27 November 2007 he was unveiled as Empoli's new head coach, replacing Luigi Cagni.[6] He was axed on 31 March 2008 following a 2–0 home defeat to U.C. Sampdoria which left Empoli down in last place in the league table.[7]
From Siena to Bologna
On 23 November 2009, he was appointed as the new head coach of Siena, replacing Marco Baroni.[8] On 21 May 2010, was released by Siena.[9]
After a successful season which saw his club finish in 16th place, six points clear of relegation, despite a three-point deduction for tax problems and running feuds over the club's ownership, Malesani was replaced by Pierpaolo Bisoli on 26 May 2011.[11]
Genoa
On 19 June 2011, Genoa officially announced that Malesani would be the new first team head coach.[12] However, after Genoa was defeated 6-1 by Napoli, Malesani was fired.[13] He returned to Genoa on 2 April 2012, taking over from Pasquale Marino who had previously replaced him only to be sacked a few months later.[14] His second stint as Genoa boss lasted however only twenty days, as he was sacked once again on 22 April after a 1–4 home loss to Siena that left Genoa one point shy of relegation, and led to massive protests from Genoa fans during the game.[15]
Palermo
However, after three matches in charge, on 24 February 2013 Malesani was relieved from his duties as the manager.[17]
Sassuolo
On 29 January 2014, it was announced Malesani had agreed to take over as new manager of Serie A team Sassuolo.[18]
Controversy
Hellas Verona
On 18 November 2001, after winning the first historical Serie A derby between Hellas Verona F.C. and Chievo Verona with the result of 3–2, Malesani wildly ran and celebrated in front of the tiers reserved to Verona supporters, even getting on his knees.[19] His behaviour was criticized, but Malesani fought back during Monica Vanali's post-match interview, arguing about his colleagues using stock phrases, claiming his managerial wins and defending his conduct, which he had anticipated to the opponent's manager Gigi Delneri.[20] Tutti là così, che fumano, che stanno fermi, che fanno "Attenti"! Ma dai, basta! (...) Il problema è questo: nel calcio - no? - oggigiorno, bisogna essere finti, bisogna essere fatti proprio con- di plastica, essere così, guarda! [Imitating a mannequin] Intervistami, Monica! Eccolo qua! Dai, fammi una domanda!  (...) L'ultimo allenatore in Europa che son stato che ha vinto, dighelo, che se lo ricorda, nessuno lo dice! Mai uno, in due anni, Monica, mai uno che l'ha detto! (...) Mai 'na voce fora dal coro, mai una, mai una che dica: "Ma sì, Malesani, corri cazzo, correte allenatori!" Ma basta, è vergognoso! (...) Davanti a una platea gli ho detto: "Gigi, non arrabbiarti, se vinco, vado sotto la curva!"— [Managers] are all like that, smokers, still, on their toes! Come on, stop it! (...) The problem is the following: in the football world - right? - nowadays, you need to be a pretender, you need to be made with- of plastic, to be like this, look at me! [Imitating a mannequin] Interview me, Monica! Here it is! Come on, ask me a question! (...) The last [Italian] manager winning in Europe, tell them, remind that, no one says that! No one, in two years, no one said that! (...) Never a lone voice, not a single one, never one saying: "All right, Malesani, fucking run, run you managers!" Stop it, it's a shame! (...) In front of an audience, I told him: "Gigi, don't get angry, if I win, I 'll go celebrating in front of the [Verona] tiers!"
Panathinaikos
On 16 December 2005, after a disappointing 2–2 draw against Iraklis, Malesani held a roaring press conference. Tired of the criticisms he and Panathinaikos had received for some poor performances both from press and supporters, he defended his hard work and dedication, as well as the club's owner Giannis Vardinogiannis, in front of the journalists.[21][22][23]

Martín Lousteau (born 8 December 1970) is an Argentine economist and politician of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) . He is National Senator for Buenos Aires. Since 2023, he has been President of the UCR National Committee.
He was Minister of Economy under the administration of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, from December 2007 to April 2008. At the age of 37, he was the youngest person to occupy this office in more than five decades.[2]
Lousteau served as the Argentine Ambassador to the United States from 2015 to 2017.[3] In 2017, Lousteau joined the UCR but was not part of Cambiemos in the Argentine Congress.[4]
From 2013 to 2019, he was a National Deputy, representing Buenos Aires. He resigned his bench at the Chamber of Deputies to be sworn in as Senator on 10 December 2019.[5]
Early career
Lousteau was born in Buenos Aires to Guillermo Lousteau Heguy and Mabel Gellón. He graduated from Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He is a Licentiate in Economics (graduated summa cum laude from the Universidad de San Andrés), and a Master of Science in Economics (at the London School of Economics). He taught as a postgraduate professor at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, and as graduate professor at the Universidad de San Andrés.[6]
He is the author of Sin Atajos (No Shortcuts, 2005), a history of Argentina's economic crises, with Javier González Fraga;[7] and Hacia un Federalismo Solidario (Towards a Cooperative Federalism), as well as specialized works and journalistic articles that have been published in Argentina and abroad. Lousteau had also been a tennis instructor (which he quit because of an injury), and worked as a war correspondent in Afghanistan for the magazines El Planeta Urbano and La Razón before the September 11 attacks.[8]
Lousteau served as chief economist and later director of APL Economía, a consulting firm founded by former Central Bank President Alfonso Prat-Gay, and went on to hold various public offices as well as positions in the private sector. He was appointed Adviser to the President of the Central Bank of Argentina in 2003, for whom he designed a bank matching scheme for the payment of the discount window loans; and served in the Central Bank's Committee on Monetary Policy until 2004). He was appointed by Governor Felipe Solá as Minister of Production of Buenos Aires Province in 2005, and late that year was named Chairman of the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires and of its parent company, the BAPRO Group, where he served from 2005 until his designation as Economy Minister in December 2007. He later co-founded a business consulting firm, LCG, with Gastón Rossi.[6]
Minister of Economy
Lousteau making his case for higher oilseed export taxes in an April 2008 press conference. The resulting conflict with the nation's agricultural sector dominated his brief tenure as Economy Minister.
Lousteau was the first minister of economy of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. There was a dispute in the cabinet at the time between Julio de Vido, Ricardo Jaime and Guillermo Moreno, and Alberto Fernández, Graciela Ocaña, Jorge Taiana and Carlos Tomada. Lousteau sided with Alberto Fernández, as he did not share the economic views of De Vido and Moreno. Fernández had promised him that both of them would be removed from government in a short time.[9] Lousteau wrote a report for the president on the figures of the national economy, praising several aspects of the tenure of Néstor Kirchner, but warning about the growing inflation. This report was dismissed by Néstor Kirchner, who did not have an actual office but remained an influential figure. He also proposed to gradually reduce the subsidies to energy consumption, to eventually abandon the fixed price system established during the 2001 crisis. Cristina Kirchner did not support his proposal.[10]
The salient feature of his tenure was the controversy surrounding his decision to increase soybean export taxes, which were previously fixed at 35%, and to have them fluctuate in line with global prices for the crop.[11] This has been claimed as the major cause of the protests in the Argentine countryside which took place in early 2008.[12] Lousteau was heavily involved in talks with farmers' leaders but was later sidelined.[13]
Lousteau was rumored as early as two months into his tenure to have declared his intention to resign as a result of disputes with fellow ministers, particularly Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno.[14] He denied he would resign; but there was nevertheless continued speculation on his resignation or replacement in the wake of the agrarian crisis.[15] Lousteau resigned on 24 April 2008, with the tax agency chief Carlos Fernández replacing him.[16]
According to The Wall Street Journal, his brief tenure was clouded from the outset by interference from former President Néstor Kirchner's allies. Lousteau's policy initiatives often seemed to be eclipsed by those of Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno, a Kirchner loyalist described as "the administration's price policeman."[17]
Later work
Following his dismissal Lousteau contributed a weekly opinion column for the conservative daily La Nación and published two best-selling books on economic theory and history, Economía 3-D (2011) and Otra vuelta a la economía (2012). He received a Yale World Fellowship in 2012.[18]
Politics in Buenos Aires
Lousteau joined the UNEN coalition, led by the centrist UCR, and was nominated to their City of Buenos Aires party list for Congress in the 2013 mid-term elections.[19] He was one of five UNEN candidates elected to Congress for the City of Buenos Aires; but ongoing differences with caucus leader Elisa Carrió led Lousteau to form his own faction (Suma + UNEN), joined by UNEN Congressmen relying in grassroots action in the UCR.[20][21]
He ran for mayor in 2015 backed by centre-left coalition called ECO (Energía Ciudadana Organizada), and was narrowly defeated by Horacio Rodríguez Larreta.[22] In these elections, PRO was stronger in wealthier northern Buenos Aires, while ECO was stronger in the southern, poorer neighborhoods of the city.[23][24]
He was appointed ambassador of Argentina to the United States by president Mauricio Macri in 2016, but he resigned the following year to run for National Deputy in the 2017 Argentine mid-term elections.[25]
In 2017 mid-term elections, Lousteau ran heading the Evolución, which included the Radical Civic Union and the Socialist Party. Despite coming in third with 12.3% of the vote, he and Carla Carrizo became National Deputies due to Argentina's proportional representation electoral system.[citation needed]
Personal life
Martín Lousteau married television actress Carla Peterson in New Haven, Connecticut, in September 2011, and the couple had a son in January 2013, Gaspar Lousteau.[26]

Julia Faye Maloney[1] (September 24, 1892[2] – April 6, 1966), known professionally as Julia Faye, was an American actress of silent and sound films.[3] She was known for her appearances in more than 30 Cecil B. DeMille productions. Her various roles ranged from maids and ingénues to vamps and queens.
She was "famed throughout Hollywood for her perfect legs" until her performance in Cecil B. DeMille's The Volga Boatman (1926) established her as "one of Hollywood's popular leading ladies."[4]
Early life
Faye was born at her grandmother's home near Richmond, Virginia.[5] Her father, Robert J. Maloney (born c. 1865),[6] worked for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.[7] Her mother, Emma Louise Elliott (1872–1955),[8] was from New Castle, Indiana.[9] Her parents had married in 1890 in Newton, Kansas.[6][10] Faye's paternal grandfather, Thomas Maloney, was born in Ireland and had immigrated to the United States in the 1850s.[11]
Faye's father died sometime before 1901,[12] when her widowed mother married Cyrus Demetrios Covell (1862–1941)[13] in Indiana. Faye took her stepfather's name and listed him as her father.
She had lived in St. Louis, Missouri, prior to coming to Hollywood in 1915, to visit friends. She visited one of the film studios and was introduced to actor and director Christy Cabanne. The two reminisced about St. Louis and discovered that they had lived next door to one another there. Cabanne persuaded Faye's reluctant mother to allow her to be in motion pictures.[14]
Career
Triangle, Fine Arts, and Keystone (1915–1916)
Faye made her debut in silent films with bit roles in Martyrs of the Alamo and The Lamb, both directed by Christy Cabanne for Triangle Film Corporation in 1915.[15] Her first credited and important role was as Dorothea opposite DeWolf Hopper's Don Quixote in the 1915 Fine Arts adaptation of the famous Miguel de Cervantes novel. Neil G. Caward, a reviewer for the film journal Motography, wrote, in his review of Don Quixote, that "both Fay Tincher as Dulcinea and Julia Faye as Dorothea add much enjoyment to the picture."[16] Faye's growing popularity increased with her appearances in several Keystone comedies, including A Movie Star, His Auto Ruination, His Last Laugh, Bucking Society, The Surf Girl, and A Lover's Might, all released in 1916. She also worked for D. W. Griffith, who gave her a minor role in Intolerance (1916).
Famous Players–Lasky (1917–1925)
Faye's first role for Cecil B. DeMille was featured in The Woman God Forgot (1917).[17] She continued working for DeMille in The Whispering Chorus, Old Wives for New, The Squaw Man and Till I Come Back to You (all 1918).
In 1919, Faye played the stenographer in Stepping Out. Cast with Enid Bennett, Niles Welch, and Gertrude Claire, Faye was complimented by a critic for playing her role with "class".[18] In DeMille's Male and Female (1919), she played Gloria Swanson's maid.
Her next film, It Pays To Advertise (1919), was a Paramount Pictures release adapted by Elmer Harris from the play of the same name by Rol Cooper Megrue and Walter Hackett. It was directed by Donald Crisp. Faye was among the actors with Lois Wilson depicting the leading lady.[19]
Faye was listed as a member of the Paramount Stock Company School in July 1922. Its noteworthy personalities included Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson, Betty Compson, Wallace Reid, Bebe Daniels, and Pola Negri.[20]
In 1923, she played The Wife of Pharaoh, one of her most famous roles, in the prologue of DeMille's The Ten Commandments.
Faye joined Raymond Griffith and ZaSu Pitts in the screen feature Changing Husbands (1924), a Leatrice Joy comedy adapted from a magazine story entitled Roles.[21]
DeMille Pictures Corporation (1925–1927)
When DeMille resigned as director general of Famous Players–Lasky, in January 1925, he became the production head of Cinema Corporation of America. He planned to direct two or three films per year and supervise the making of between ten and twenty more. Faye came along with him as did Joy, Rod La Roque, Florence Vidor, Mary Astor, and Vera Reynolds.[22]
The Volga Boatman (1926) was directed by DeMille and named for the noted Russian song. William Boyd, Elinor Fair, and Faye have primary roles in a production DeMille called "his greatest achievement in picture making."[23] Faye's depiction of a "tiger woman" was esteemed as the most captivating of her career, to this point.[24] Before this role she had been known for "silken siren roles". Theodore Kosloff played opposite her as a stupid blacksmith.[25]
Faye played Martha in The King of Kings (1927). Christ, portrayed by H.B. Warner, is introduced with great majesty in the DeMille photodrama. A blind child searches for the Lord and the producer/director turns the camera gradually down to the child's eyes. The viewer sees Christ initially like the blind child whose sight is restored.[26] Faye traveled to New York City for personal appearances in association with The King of Kings and to address a sales convention in Chicago, Illinois.[27]
Faye won critical acclaim for her leading performance in the 60-minute silent comedy Turkish Delight (1927),[28] directed by Paul Sloane for DeMille Pictures Corporation. She was featured as Velma in the 1927 DeMille-produced film adaptation of the play Chicago; she has the distinction of being the first actress to portray Velma on-screen.
Sound films (1928–1957)
Faye had a small role as an inmate in DeMille's The Godless Girl (1929), which featured some talking sequences, but she made her "talkie" debut playing Marcia Towne in DeMille's first sound film, Dynamite (1929), co-starring Conrad Nagel, Kay Johnson, and Charles Bickford. Dynamite was also her first Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film. She also appeared in two other MGM productions, the Marion Davies comedy Not So Dumb (1930) and DeMille's third and final remake of The Squaw Man (1931), before her brief retirement from films in the early 1930s.
After a short-lived marriage, Faye returned to films with a minor role in Till We Meet Again (1936) and would go on to appear in every one of DeMille's films after Union Pacific (1939), which marked her return to DeMille films. In Samson and Delilah (1949), she had a prominent supporting role as Delilah's maidservant, Hisham. In The Ten Commandments (1956), she played Elisheba, Aaron's wife. Her last role was as a dowager in the 1958 remake of DeMille's The Buccaneer, produced by DeMille himself but directed by his son-in-law Anthony Quinn.
Personal life
Faye married Harold Leroy Wallick on August 2, 1913, in Manhattan.[29] Wallick predeceased her, and she is listed as a widow in the 1930 census.[30][31]
Faye first met Cecil B. DeMille in 1917 and became one of his mistresses. In 1920, Faye resided at 2450 Glendower Avenue in Los Feliz.[32] She later bought a Colonial Revival-style mansion at 2338 Observatory Avenue, also in Los Feliz.[33]
Faye married screenwriter[34] Walter Anthony Merrill on October 24, 1935, in Los Angeles.[35] In April 1936, she announced that she had obtained a Nevada divorce from Merrill. [34]
Faye began writing a memoir, Flicker Faces, in the mid-1940s. Although it remains unpublished, some excerpts from the memoir are included in author Scott Eyman's 2010 biography of DeMille, Empire of Dreams: The Epic Life of Cecil B. DeMille.
Death
Faye died of cancer at her home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles,[36] on April 6, 1966, at the age of 73. Her cremated remains rest in the Colonnade at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
Legacy
For her contributions to the American film industry, Faye was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6500 Hollywood Boulevard.[37] Her memoir, preserved in The Cecil B. DeMille Archives at Brigham Young University, has yet to be published.

Wong Liu Tsong (January 3, 1905 – February 3, 1961), known professionally as Anna May Wong, was an American actress, considered the first Chinese American film star in Hollywood,[1] as well as the first Chinese American actress to gain international recognition.[2] Her varied career spanned silent film, sound film, television, stage, and radio.
Born in Los Angeles to first-generation Taishanese Chinese American parents, Wong became engrossed with films and decided at the age of 11 that she would become an actress. Her first role was as an extra in the movie The Red Lantern (1919). During the silent film era, she acted in The Toll of the Sea (1922), one of the first films made in color, and in Douglas Fairbanks' The Thief of Bagdad (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Wong had been one of the first to embrace the flapper look. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her the "world's best dressed woman."[3] In the 1920s and 1930s, Wong was acclaimed as one of the top fashion icons.
Frustrated by the stereotypical supporting roles she reluctantly played in Hollywood, Wong left for Europe in March 1928, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them Piccadilly (1929). She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the United States and Europe for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, and went on to appear in Daughter of the Dragon (1931), with Marlene Dietrich in Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express (1932), Java Head (1934), and Daughter of Shanghai (1937).[4]
In 1935, Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in the film version of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth. MGM instead cast Luise Rainer to play the leading role in yellowface. One biographer believes that the choice was due to the Hays Code anti-miscegenation rules requiring the wife of a white actor, Paul Muni (ironically playing a Chinese character in yellowface) to be played by a white actress.[5] But the 1930–1934 Hays Code of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America insisted only that "miscegenation (sex relationship between the white and black races) was forbidden" and said nothing about other interracial marriages.[6] Other biographers have not corroborated this theory, including historian Shirley Jennifer Lim's Anna May Wong: Performing the Modern.[7] MGM screen-tested Wong for the supporting role of Lotus, the seductress, but it is ambiguous whether she refused the role on principle or was rejected.[8]
Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village, studying Chinese culture, and documenting the experience on film at a time when prominent female directors in Hollywood were few.[9]
In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese and Chinese Americans in a positive light.
She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to help the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.
In 1951, Wong made history with her television show The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, the first-ever U.S. television show starring an Asian-American series lead.[10] She had been planning to return to film in Flower Drum Song when she died in 1961, at the age of 56, from a heart attack. For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical "Dragon Lady" and demure "Butterfly" roles that she was often given. Her life and career were re-evaluated in the years around the centennial of her birth, in three major literary works and film retrospectives.
Biography
Early life
This is a duplicate copy of the Certificate of Identity issued to actress Anna May Wong.
Anna May Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong (黃柳霜, Liu Tsong literally meaning "willow frost") on January 3, 1905, on Flower Street in Los Angeles, one block north of Chinatown, in an integrated community of Chinese, Irish, German and Japanese residents.[11][12] She was the second of seven children born to Wong Sam-sing, owner of the Sam Kee Laundry, and his second wife, Lee Gon-toy.[13]
Wong's parents were second-generation Chinese Americans; her maternal and paternal grandparents had arrived in the U.S. no later than 1855.[14] Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in Michigan Bluffs, a gold-mining area in Placer County. He had come from Chang On, a village near Taishan, Guangdong Province, China, in 1853.[15] Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890.[16] He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother.[17] Anna May's older sister Lew-ying (Lulu) was born in 1902,[14] and Anna May in 1905, followed by six more children: James (1907–1971), Mary (1910–1940), Frank (1912–1989), Roger (1915–1983), Marietta (1919–1920), and Richard Wong (1922–2007).[18]
In 1910, the family moved to a neighborhood on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese people on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture.[19] She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students, they moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese-language school afternoons and on Saturdays.[20]
About that same time, U.S. motion picture production began to relocate from the East Coast to the Los Angeles area. Movies were shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood. She began going to Nickelodeon movie theaters and quickly became obsessed with the "flickers", missing school and using lunch money to attend the cinema. Her father was not happy with her interest in films, feeling that it interfered with her studies, but Wong decided to pursue a film career regardless. At the age of nine, she constantly begged filmmakers to give her roles, earning herself the nickname "C.C.C." or "Curious Chinese Child".[21] By the age of 11, Wong had come up with her stage name of Anna May Wong, formed by joining both her English and family names.[22]
Early career
Wong was working at Hollywood's Ville de Paris department store when Metro Pictures needed 300 female extras to appear in Alla Nazimova's film The Red Lantern (1919). Without her father's knowledge, a friend of his with movie connections helped her land an uncredited role as an extra carrying a lantern.[23]
Wong worked steadily for the next two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods.[24] Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life.[25] The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism, and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.[26] However, she never officially joined the church, and her interest in it waned as she became involved with the New Thought Unity Church.[27]
Finding it difficult to keep up with both her schoolwork and her passion, Wong dropped out of Los Angeles High School in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career.[28][29] Reflecting on her decision, Wong told Motion Picture Magazine in 1931: "I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10 years to succeed as an actress."[30]
In 1921, Wong received her first screen credit for Bits of Life, the first anthology film, in which she played the wife of Lon Chaney's character, Toy Ling, in a segment entitled "Hop".[31] She later recalled it fondly as the only time she played the role of a mother;[32] her appearance earned her a cover photo on the British magazine Picture Show.
At the age of 17, Wong played her first leading role, in the early Metro two-color Technicolor movie The Toll of the Sea.[33] Written by Frances Marion, the story was based loosely on Madama Butterfly. Variety magazine singled Wong out for praise, noting her "extraordinarily fine" acting.[34] The New York Times commented, "Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched nine times out of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy ... She should be seen again and often on the screen."[35]
Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved reluctant to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing her as a leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't know what to do with her."[36] She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing "exotic atmosphere",[37] for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning's Drifting (1923).[30] Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles.[38] Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you're climbin

Biography
He was the son of Jean Daullé, a silversmith, and his wife, Anne née Dennel. At the age of fourteen, he received training from an engraver named Robart, at the priory of Saint-Pierre d'Abbeville.
He then went to Paris, and worked at the studios of Robert Hecquet (1693-1775), who was also originally from Picardy. In 1735, his work attracted the attention of the engraver and merchant, Pierre-Jean Mariette, who provided him with professional recommendations. Soon after, he was approached by the painter, Hyacinthe Rigaud, who wanted to make him his official engraver.
In 1742, Daullé was received at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, with his presentation, "Hyacinthe Rigaud Painting his Wife", after a work by Rigaud. He was also admitted as a member of the academy in Augsbourg. Eventually named "Engraver to the King", he trained the future publisher and print dealer, Pierre-François Basan, as well as the German engraver Jean-Georges Wille.
Around 1745, he married Gabrielle-Anne Landry and they had five children. Overwhelmed by his large family, his work suffered.
Work
He engraved several portraits and plates of historical and other subjects, which are chiefly executed with the graver in a clear and firm style, which entitles him to rank with the ablest artists of his time. He marked his works J. D. The following are his principal plates:[1]

Notes
-----
Daniel Paul Charles was a French musician, musicologist and philosopher. He was born on 27 November 1935 in Oran (Algeria) and died on 21 August 2008 in Antibes (France).
Biography
He was a student of Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatory of Music (First Prize, 1956), he received the aggregation in philosophy in 1959 and a PhD under the direction of Mikel Dufrenne in 1977.
After leading (late 1968) the Commission charged with establishing the status of professorship of music at the French Ministry of Education, he founded and lead for twenty years (1969–1989) the Department of Music of University of Paris VIII (Vincennes, and St. Denis). He was also responsible, from 1970 to 1980, for the teaching of general aesthetics at the University of Paris IV (Sorbonne). He decided to end his career by teaching philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis (1989–1999).
When he graduated from the Paris Conservatory of Music in 1956, he participated in the GRM under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer, and proposed to set into electronic music Stéphane Mallarmé's "Coup de dés" in Darmstadt, a project which caught the attention of Karlheinz Stockhausen. But his lack of enthusiasm toward the "solfège des bruits" of Schaeffer led him to focus instead on John Cage, whom he met in 1958. He contributed then to present Cage's music and philosophy in France: Pour les oiseaux (co-signed with Cage), published first in French (Paris, Belfond, 1976) became a classic book. It was later published in English: For the Birds.
Daniel Charles has been invited by many universities to lecture (usually across the Atlantic, but also including Japan and the Philippines), and has published many articles and several books, five of which have been translated into German, and two into Japanese.

<s> For other people named Gilberto, see Gilberto. For another footballer named "Gilberto da Silva", see Gilberto da Silva Melo. For the footballer born 1987, see Gilberto Silva (Portuguese footballer).
In this Portuguese name, the first or maternal family name is Aparecido and the second or paternal family name is da Silva.
Gilberto Aparecido da Silva (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʒiwˈbɛʁtu ˈsiwvɐ] ⓘ; born 7 October 1976) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, most notably for Brazilian side Atlético Mineiro and for English Premier League club Arsenal, as well as for the Brazil national team. He currently serves as an ambassador for both Arsenal and FIFA. 
Born and raised in poverty in the Brazilian municipality of Lagoa da Prata, Gilberto joined the youth academy at local club América Mineiro, where he made his senior debut as a centre-back in 1998.[3] After starring the following season, where he helped gain the club promotion into the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, he joined city rivals Atlético Mineiro. During his time at Atlético, Gilberto transitioned into a defensive midfielder under head coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, and flourished in his new role, gaining a call-up to the Brazil national team for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he featured prominently as his country won the tournament.[4]
As a result of his World Cup performances, Gilberto garnered a move to the Premier League to sign for Arsenal that summer for a fee of £4.5 million.[5] During his six years at Arsenal, Gilberto gained a reputation as a world class defensive midfielder, and starred in a midfield duo alongside Patrick Vieira.[6] He would feature as a member of the Invincibles, where he captured his first top-flight league title as his team went undefeated the whole season, as well as winning two FA Cups. Gilberto also holds distinct records at Arsenal, recording their first goal at the Emirates Stadium,[7] as well as their fastest ever goal, scoring in 21 seconds from kickoff against PSV Eindhoven in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League.[8] After departing Arsenal, Gilberto relocated to Greece, playing for Panathinaikos, where he won a domestic double. He then returned to Brazil in 2011, signing for Grêmio, where he remained for two years, before returning to Atlético to win the 2013 Copa Libertadores prior to retiring.
Gilberto featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing Brazil over a period of 9 years. He enjoyed a period of sustained success with his country, as he featured prominently in their victorious campaign at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as being a core component as the team also won the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, while also featuring as captain in their Copa América win in 2007. After retaining the Confederations Cup in 2009, Gilberto expressed his desire to prolong his club career, which coincided with limited playing time for Brazil. He retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having made 93 appearances for Brazil.
Early life
As a child, Gilberto lived in the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters.[3] His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luciânia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as "[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence".[9] In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining América Mineiro as a youth player.[10] It was during these years at América Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a central defender. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto's father retired leaving the 16-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother's ill-health.[10][11]
We were a poor family and had to work hard. That's why, as a boy, I had to take those jobs as a labourer and in the factory. But I'm glad I had that tough start. It makes me identify with people who are not so lucky.
Because of the low wage at América Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream.[13] As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates.[3][14]
Club career
Early career
In 1997, Gilberto's friends convinced him to give football another try, which led to him re-signing for América Mineiro in 1997, this time as a full-time professional.[15] Aged 22, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for América Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency.[14] He helped them win the Série B division, and consequently gain promotion to Série A.[16]
During Gilberto's third season at América Mineiro, with the team back to Série B after relegation in Série A in 1999, he scored three goals, helping the club reach the second stage where they were eliminated by Vila Nova in the quarterfinals.[17] In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club Atlético Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right tibia and, as a result, missed a number of games.[14] In his second season, he was moved by the manager Carlos Alberto Parreira from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.[18]
Arsenal
Gilberto's performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, "It would be fantastic to play against the likes of David Beckham again."[19] As a result, FA Premier League clubs Aston Villa and Arsenal led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atlético Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of Austria; while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atlético Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto.[20][21] There was also an issue of obtaining a UK work permit for Gilberto.[22] Despite the complications, Gilberto ended a summer of speculation and joined Arsenal on 7 August 2002 for a fee of £4.5 million. Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said, "What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best."[20][23]
When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire.[24] Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London.[25] However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool in the second half of the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal.[26] As the 2002–03 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto's good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002.[27]
2003–04 was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the Premier League title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3–1 Community Shield win over Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at Bolton Wanderers on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first it was reported that he would be out of action for a month.[28] Later reports suggested the injury could be season-threatening.[29]
If you never give up then you always have a chance, and they got a great example from a World Cup winner. You only have to see where Gilberto was when we got the ball back and where he was when he scored his goal. Remember this is a guy who has won everything.
Gilberto's doctor ordered him to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the fractured bone.[31] Gilberto returned to his native Brazil for the duration of his rehabilitation.[32] During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career.[31] Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team;[33] some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him.[20]
In June 2005, football agent Jacques Lichtenstein took Atlético Mineiro to court over Gilberto's transfer in 2002. Lichtenstein's lawyer argued that he and his informal partner, Ronny Rosenthal, never received an allegedly agreed 10% commission from Gilberto's £4.5 million transfer to Arsenal from Atlético Mineiro in July 2002.[34] Arsène Wenger and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein both gave evidence in court, saying that Arsenal dealt directly with Atlético Mineiro and that no agent was involved in the deal.[35] The case was conducted before The Hon. Mr Justice Jack, who on 29 June ruled against Lichtenstein, and ordered the claimants pay Atletico Minéiro £94,000 in legal costs.[36] A year later, the case could have caused problems for Arsenal, when former player Ashley Cole criticised the club for "hypocrisy and double standards" in the way they approached Gilberto.[37]
With legal matters subsided, the 2005–06 season began. Following midfielder and team captain Patrick Vieira's departure from Arsenal, Gilberto became a senior member of the Arsenal team.[9] Shortly into the season, in September 2005, his desire to see his career out with the club led to Gilberto extending his Arsenal contract to June 2009.[citation needed] A month later this loyalty was repaid when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto made his first appearance for Arsenal as captain, against Sparta Prague.[38] Although Gilberto had a period of bad form during the winter months of the season, his good defensive performances during the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League (in particular, games against Real Madrid,[39] Juventus[40][41] and Villarreal[42]) gained him praise. On 17 May 2006 Gilbert

<s> Lewis NkosiNkosi at the Centre for the Study of Southern African Literature and Languages, University of Durban-Westville, 2001Born(1936-12-05)5 December 1936Embo, KwaZulu-Natal, South AfricaDied5 September 2010(2010-09-05) (aged 73)Johannesburg, South AfricaNationalitySouth AfricanOccupation(s)Novelist, journalist, essayist, poetNotable workMating Birds (1986); Mandela's Ego (2006)
Lewis Nkosi (5 December 1936 – 5 September 2010) was a South African writer and journalist, who spent 30 years in exile as a consequence of restrictions placed on him and his writing by the Suppression of Communism Act and the Publications and Entertainment Act passed in the 1950s and 1960s. A multifaceted personality, he attempted multiple genre for his writing, including literary criticism, poetry, drama, novels, short stories, essays, as well as journalism.
Early life
Nkosi was born in a traditional Zulu family in a place called Embo in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He attended local schools, before enrolling at M. L. Sultan Technical College in Durban.[1]
Later life
Nkosi in his early twenties began working as a journalist, first in Durban, joining the weekly publication Ilanga lase Natal ("Natal sun") in 1955, and then in Johannesburg for Drum magazine and as chief reporter for Drum's Sunday newspaper, the Golden City Post, from 1956 to 1960.[2]
Literary career in South Africa
He contributed essays to many magazines and newspapers. His essays criticised apartheid and the racist state, as a result of which the South African government banned his works.
Life as an exile
Nkosi faced severe restrictions on his writing due to the publishing regulations found in the Suppression of Communism Act and the Publications and Entertainment Act passed in the 1950s and 1960s. His works were banned under the Suppression of Communism Act,[3] and he faced severe restrictions as a writer. At the same time, he became the first black South African journalist to win a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University to pursue his studies.[4] When he applied for permission to go to United States, Nkosi was granted a one-way exit permit to leave South Africa, thus being barred from returning. In 1961, accepting the scholarship to study at Harvard (1961–1962), he began a 30-year exile.
In 1962, he attended the African Writers Conference at Makerere University, along with the likes of Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Ezekiel Mphahlele.[5] Moving to London, Nkosi obtained work with the BBC and between 1962 and 1965 produced the radio programme Africa Abroad, also interviewing major African writers for the television series African Writers of Today on NET, and serving as literary editor for The New African magazine (1965–1968).[6] He appeared in Three Swings on a Pendulum, a programme about "Swinging London" in 1967, which can be viewed on BBC iplayer.[7]
In 1970, he was visiting Regents professor at the University of California-Irvine, and having earned a BA degree in English literature from the University of London (1974) and an MA from the University of Sussex (1977), he went on to become a Professor of English at the University of Wyoming (1991–91), as well as holding visiting teaching positions at universities in Zambia and in Warsaw, Poland.[6]
Return to South Africa
Lewis Nkosi returned to South Africa in 2001, after a gap of nearly four decades.  His final years before his death in 2010 were passed in financial difficulties and ill health. He was apparently injured in a car crash in 2009 and spent his time on the bed, slowly recuperating from the wounds; however, a recovery never really happened and he drifted towards death. Despite Nkosi being considered an African literary legend, none of his efforts in literature gave him any economic relief and his friends and fans gathered a charity fund to pay his last medical bills.[8]
Nkosi died aged 73 on Sunday, 5 September 2010, at the Johannesburg Wellness Clinic.[9] survived by his partner, Astrid Starck-Adler, and his twin daughters, Joy and Louise.[10] A memorial service for Nkosi was held on 8 September at the Museum Africa, Newtown Cultural Precinct, in Johannesburg, and his funeral took place in Durban on 10 September.[11]
Works
Novels
Though Nkosi started his literary career in the 1960s, he entered the realm of fiction much later than his Drum colleagues. His first novel, Mating Birds, was published in 1986.[12] His next novel, Underground People, came out in 2002[13] and his third novel, Mandela's Ego, in 2006.[14]
Mating Birds (1986)
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Mating Birds is the narration of an educated South African black native called Ndi Sibiya. He narrates the story from prison, awaiting a death sentence. As a jobless youth Sibiya wanders the city of Durban and reaches the segregated beach. There he finds a white girl on the other side of the fence (on the white side of the beach). They silently exchange looks and enter into a muted affair. They were well aware that race laws in South Africa would sentence them to imprisonment if caught. The white girl intentionally allows her naked body to be seen by Sibiya. He takes the entire episode as a love affair between the white girl and himself. The girl with her regular appearances on the beach and seeming interest dupes Sibiya into believing her.
After several silent meetings on the beach, Sibiya follows her to her bungalow, finds her lonely and willing, and enters into sexual copulation. But they are discovered by neighbours, and the white girl accuses Sibiya of rape. A trial by white judges begins. In the court, the white girl, Veronica, denies any knowledge of Sibiya and reiterates the charge of rape against him. The court finds Sibiya guilty and sentences him to death.
The novel generated a controversy and received critical attention, being awarded the Macmillan Silver Pen Prize in 1986. The New York Times declared the novel one of the best hundred books of 1986.
Underground People (2002)
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Nkosi's second novel, Underground People, is a political thriller. In this novel, he moved away from the theme of inter-racial sexual relations and centred the story on the armed struggle in South Africa.
Cornelius Molapo is a language teacher and a member of the National Liberation Movement, an organisation waging armed war against the racist white minority government. He is a poet, a great orator, hungry reader of many books, and even plays cricket. He often criticises the policy of the Central Committee and irks its members. To counter him, they draw a strategy. The Central Committee of the Organization advises Cornelius to go to a remote part of the country called Tabanyane and to participate in peasant uprisings. The Central Committee plans to make use of his absence from mainstream life into an act of abduction by the Government. At first he hesitates, but reluctantly agrees. After reaching Tabanyane, Cornelius organises the poor illiterate jobless country men into revolutionary men and leads them. In this task, he enlists the support of Princess Madi, who is a daughter of the deposed chief of Tabanyane. During the clandestine operations, he takes two white hostages into his custody. However, he is unwilling to execute the unarmed civilians.
Meanwhile, the Central Committee starts a big propaganda about the disappearance of Cornelius from duties. They blame it on the South African police, who deny any knowledge of him. The National Liberation Movement brings the matter to international organisations including the United Nations and Human Rights International. The latter sends its official Anthony Ferguson, who was born in South Africa and immigrated to England, to investigate the matter. Anthony's sister and mother are still living in South Africa. After some rest he undertakes to search for Cornelius unsuccessfully.
The Central Committee members, plagued by jealousy of his success as a revolutionary, want to use the issue of white hostages for the release of their leader from prison, engage in talks with the Government and to observe a ceasefire. But contrary to the expectations of the Central Committee, Cornelius defies them and conducts attacks on the police stations and other locations. To escape police persecution, Cornelius leaves his hideout, and allows the white hostages to leave unharmed. The white hostages reach police and recognise Cornelius's photo and confirm his active presence in the fight.
Naturally, police suspect the intentions of Anthony Ferguson and ask him to go to Tabanyane, to convince Cornelius to surrender. He takes the help of a member of the Central Committee and reaches Tabanyane. However, Cornelius refuses to surrender and ditch the people for whom he had been fighting. Eventually, the police shoot, and he dies.

Nkosi's third novel, Mandela's Ego (2006), is the story of Dumisani Gumede, a teenage boy who has come of age in a Zulu village and runs after every girl and woman to satiate his newly acquired power. His uncle Simon tells him many stories about Nelson Mandela and makes him a follower of the great leader. Uncle Simon's storytelling is invested with lies and half-truths. He also tells Dumisani that Mandela is a great pursuer of women. Taking cue from the "real life" of Mandela, Dumisani goes unstopped in his conquests. In his village, every girl falls for his charms except Nobuhle, a beautiful orphaned girl. Dumisani's admiration for Mandela goes to the extent of starting a football club, with Dumisani as its chairman. He even goes to the city of Pietermartizburg to see Mandela, who comes there to address a convention demanding equal rights for all races and a dialogue among all the races.
After his schooling, Dumisani joins a tourist company as a guide. Dumisani's friend Sofa Sonke, driver of the tourist bus, brings every day a newspaper from Durban for him. After many attempts to win Nobuhle, Dumisani finally succeeds and gets accepted by her. She invites him to meet her on the river bank. On the same day, Dumisani receives the news of Mandela's arrest. The news shocks him and takes his nerve away. When Dumisani tries to unite with Nobuhle, his body fails. He tries again but his sexual energy deserts him. Nobuhle leaves in tears.
Dumisani consults many witch doctors, tribal doctors and conventional doctors in hospitals. But nothing works to cure him. He leaves his home, wanders the country aimlessly for years. When he reaches middle age, one day he hears the news of Mandela's release from prison. He attends the first public address of Mandela after the release. He rejoices. In his joy, he huddles a woman next to him, and his lost sexual urge returns. His life is restored.

Kourosh ZolaniZolani performing music on the santurBackground informationBorn1970 (age 53–54)[1]OriginIranGenresContemporary worldOccupation(s)Composer; soloistInstrument(s)santurYears active2000–presentWebsiteOfficial WebsiteMusical artist
Kourosh Zolani (born 1970) is an Iranian-American composer and instrumental soloist. He is known for designing and playing a chromatic santour.[2][3]
His compositions based on using his unique[4] chromatic Santour include Memoirs of Sangesar, Dance of Change and Peaceful Planet.[5][6][note 1]
Personal life
Zolani was the youngest of ten children was raised in a poverty-stricken home in the small village of Sangesar, Iran.[7] From an early age, he had dreamed of being a musician in spite of having to work hard alongside his siblings to make ends meet.[7]
Zolani developed a passion for musical expression and learned to play the santour at age 14 and left home as a young adult to pursue his passion at the University of Art in Tehran.[2] He studied classical composition and trained with Master Farāmarz Pāyvar.[1]
Professional background
Zolani is known for the development of a new tuning technique for the santour, which is an ancient Iranian instrument. The traditional Iranian santour is a diatonic instrument, which is relative to playing a piano without the use of the black keys. Zolani enhanced the instrument by creating a chromatic santour, which essentially allows the use of both black and white keys. Over the history of the Persian santour, unsuccessful attempts had been made to create a chromatic santour, but the enhanced instrument remained in experimental phases, never becoming functional. Zolani's change and enhancement of the santour was an historical first in the presentation and playing capabilities of the instrument. The transformation allowed for more chromatic and complex orchestral versatility.[2][3][4]
Since 1995, Zolani has performed his original compositions in concerts in Washington, D.C., as well as the ancient Roman city of Jerash in Jordan,[4] featuring his new chromatic santour.[2] He participated as a santour player in David Arkenstone's Atlantis album,[8][9] which received a Grammy Award nomination for the Best New Age Album of the Year.[10]
In November 2009, Zolani released a collection of his original work, entitled Memoirs of Sangesar.[11] In 2004, his album, Peaceful Planet was awarded the Best Solo Instrumental Album of the Year[12] in the Just Plain Folks Music Organization's International Contest.[13] He has also received The Elaine Weissman Los Angeles Treasures Award from The City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and The California Traditional Music Society.[14]

He made one start for Fresno before having his contract purchased on April 10 when Ryan Jensen went on the disabled list. On April 14, he made his major league debut in relief. On April 22, he made his first major league start against the Pittsburgh Pirates, but got the loss as he only lasted 4 innings and gave up 5 runs. He would get his first major league win on May 3 against the Cincinnati Reds when he went 51⁄3 innings and gave up 4 runs.
On August 20, 2003, he was pulled from a start against the Atlanta Braves after pitching just 32⁄3 innings. He was diagnosed with neuritis in his right elbow. He then underwent Tommy John surgery in September 2003. He went 8-9 with a 5.03 ERA in 2003.
He would pitch in the final game of the 2004 season against the Los Angeles Dodgers. It would be his only game of that season. He pitched 1 inning of scoreless relief, striking out two.
Foppert spent the first two months of the 2005 with Fresno. He made 3 appearances (2 starts) in June for the Giants. On July 30, 2005, he was then traded to the Seattle Mariners along with catcher Yorvit Torrealba for outfielder Randy Winn. For the rest of the 2005 season, he would pitch for the Mariners Triple A team, the Tacoma Rainiers including 2 starts in the postseason for them.
Foppert played in just 5 games for the Rainiers in 2006 after spending most of the season on the disabled list.
Foppert was released on March 19, 2007 from the Mariners after failing to make the club as a nonroster invitee. He rejoined the Giants on March 24, 2007 when he was signed to a minor league contract. Foppert began the 2008 season with the Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League. He became a free agent at the end of the season and re-signed with the Giants in December.  In June 2009, the Giants released Foppert.
Personal life
Foppert resides in Greenbrae with his wife, McKenna (the daughter of former NFL quarterback Craig Morton), and is the head coach at Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield. In the 2012/2013 season, his first as the varsity head coach, Foppert's Wildcats went 15–12. Jesse also runs the Jesse Foppert Pitching Academy which is based in Kentfield.

Botak ChinMugshot of Botak ChinBornWong Swee Chin3 March 1951Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia)Died11 June 1981 (age 30)[1]Pudu Prison, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia[2]Cause of deathExecution by hangingCriminal statusSentence fulfilled on 11 June 1981Conviction(s)Armed robberyCriminal penaltyDeath
Wong Swee Chin, known professionally as Edmund Tan / Louis Ling / Botak Chin (3 March 1951–11 June 1981) was a Malaysian criminal and gangster. He rose to fame as one of the most notorious and dangerous gangsters during the 1960s and 1970s. He and his friend Kevin Yee Kai Kit were known for conducting armed robberies, which in a few cases involved huge amounts of cash. He was respected by the Chinese Hakka community and often regarded as modern-age Robin Hood, as some say he shared the cash from the robberies with the poor. On the evening of 16 February 1976, he was arrested by the police. He was executed on 11 June 1981 in Pudu Prison.
Early life
Botak Chin was born in Kuala Lumpur on 3 March 1951 to a family of 10 siblings. His father worked with Malayan Railways, and as a child he lived at the Malaysian Railway quarters adjacent to the Caltex station on Jalan Ipoh in Kuala Lumpur.
He studied at a Chinese vernacular primary school and then went on to attend the Methodist Boys' Secondary School in Sentul until Form 3. 
After dropping out from school, Botak Chin worked as a fishmonger at the market at Jalan Tun Ismail (formerly known as Maxwell Road). After his mother's death, he often spent time away from home, with his friends who were the local hoodlums that eventually led him to commit petty crimes. He joined a gang named Gang 360 (Sam Pak Lok), and he was impressed by the firearms possessed by the gang members. On 19 April 1969, Botak Chin and two of his friends took part in a robbery for the first time. At the age of 18, he proudly owned his first firearm, a .22 calibre revolver. He then formed his own gang shortly thereafter and proceeded to engage in robbery sprees.[3]
Crime sprees
Botak Chin engaged in eight robberies within a month in 1969. This led to his first arrest; he was convicted and sentenced to prison for 7 years. He was released before serving out his sentence and resolved to retire from gangsterism. However, his attempt to become clean and sell vegetables was unsatisfying financially;[4]  and he returned to crime.
Personal life
Dr. Mahadevan, the former director of Tanjung Rambutan Mental Hospital in Ipoh, Perak, treated Botak Chin for 19 days to determine if he was adequately sane to stand trial. He found Botak Chin to be highly intelligent – but a "misguided genius".[5]

Gabriela Beatriz Sabatini (Spanish pronunciation: [gaˈβɾjela saβaˈtini]; born 16 May 1970) is an Argentine former professional tennis player.[1] A former world No. 3 in both singles and doubles, Sabatini was one of the leading players from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, amassing 41 titles. In singles, Sabatini won the 1990 US Open, the Tour Finals in 1988 and 1994, and was runner-up at Wimbledon 1991, the 1988 US Open, and the silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics. In doubles, Sabatini won Wimbledon in 1988 partnering Steffi Graf, and reached three French Open finals. Among Open era players who did not reach the world No. 1 ranking, Sabatini has the most wins over reigning world No. 1 ranked players.[2] In 2006, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2018 Tennis Magazine ranked her as the 20th-greatest female player of the preceding 50 years.
Childhood and junior career
Sabatini was born 16 May 1970 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Osvaldo and Beatriz Garofalo Sabatini. Her father was an executive in General Motors.[3] Her elder brother, Osvaldo, is an actor and producer.[4]
Sabatini started playing tennis at the age of six, and won her first tournament at eight. In 1983, age 13, she became the youngest player ever to win the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. She won the girls' singles at the 1984 French Open and the US Open girls' doubles with fellow Argentinian Mercedes Paz. Sabatini reached world No. 1 in the junior rankings that year and was named 1984 Junior World Champion by the International Tennis Federation.
Sabatini stated that she deliberately lost matches in her youth to avoid having to do on-court interviews and therefore avoid media attention. She said that her shyness had been a major problem, and she thought she had to speak on-court after playing in the final of a tournament; so, she would lose in the semifinals.[5][6][7]
Career
Early years
In 1985, aged 15 years and three weeks, Sabatini became one of the youngest-ever players to reach the semifinals of the French Open, where she lost to Chris Evert. She won her first WTA Tour singles title later that year in Tokyo. She first entered the world's top ten (at #10) in September 1985,[8] and ended the year ranked number 12. She received the WTA Newcomer of the Year award.
Sabatini reached the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1986, losing to Martina Navratilova, before winning her second WTA title in Buenos Aires, She re-entered the world's top ten in September 1986 and would remain there for 508 consecutive weeks until May 1996.
Sabatini reached the semifinals of the 1987 French Open, and reached the final of the 1987 WTA Tour Championships, losing to Steffi Graf both times. She also won three WTA titles, including defeating world No. 4, Pam Shriver in Brighton.
1988: US Open and Olympics finals; WTA Finals champion
In February 1988, Sabatini entered the top five in rankings, and would remain there uninterrupted until August 1993.[9] Having reached her third French Open semifinal, she then reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the US Open, where she lost to Graf in three sets. Sabatini represented Argentina in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul and was selected to carry her country's flag in the opening ceremony. She went on to win the silver medal in the women's singles competition, losing to Graf in the final. Sabatini teamed-up with Graf to win the women's doubles title at Wimbledon that year. At the end of 1988, Sabatini won her first WTA Tour Championships, without dropping a set.
1989
In 1989, Sabatini reached seven tournament finals and won four titles, including the Miami Open (defeating Evert in the final). In defeating world No. 2, Martina Navratilova, and No. 1, Steffi Graf, to obtain the Amelia Island title, she became only the fifth player in Open Era history to defeat both the No. 1 and 2 ranked players at the same tournament.[10] She also reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and US Open Grand Slam tournaments.
1990: US Open champion
At the Australian Open, Sabatini sprained her ankle during a third-round match while one set up, and had to be taken off Centre Court in a wheelchair. 80 minutes later, in the following match, Mark Woodforde also sprained his ankle on the same court and was forced to retire by wheelchair too.[11] Multiple players had complained of the dangers of playing on the Rebound Ace hard court surface used at the tournament, which they claimed became very sticky – and therefore potentially dangerous – in very hot conditions.[12] Sabatini was sidelined for six weeks by the injury, returning to the tour in mid-March and winning her first tournament back – the Virginia Slims of Florida – without the loss of a set.
She reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon, losing to eventual champion Martina Navratilova, in straight sets.
At the US Open, Sabatini progressed to her second Grand Slam final where she defeated world No. 1 Graf in straight sets 6–2, 7–6 to win the title, having saved two set points against her while 5-6 down in the second set. She credited her win with being more aggressive and coming to the net whenever she could to attack Graf's shorter balls. Sabatini also beat Graf in the semifinals of the WTA Championships in Madison Square Garden later that year, losing in the final to Monica Seles, 6–4, 5–7, 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. It was the first five-set match to be played on the women's tour since 1901.[13]
1991: Wimbledon final
Sabatini won five tournaments in the first half of the year. She beat three top five players (Graf, Navratilova and Fernandez) on her way to winning the title in Tokyo, and beat Graf on three further occasions in Boca Raton, Key Biscayne and Amelia Island. In the Italian Open final, Sabatini defeated world no. 1 Seles for the loss of just five games. She reached the semifinals at Roland Garros (saving two match points in defeating Jana Novotná in the quarter-finals) and then her third Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Graf 4–6, 6–3, 6–8 (having served for the match twice). Sabatini came close to attaining the world No. 1 ranking in 1991, but was narrowly denied by Graf and then Monica Seles. All three players' rankings were within a few points of each other for much of the year. Her year was capped by receiving the WTA Most Improved Player of the Year award.
1992
Sabatini reached eight finals and won five titles, including her fourth Italian Open (where she beat world No. 1 Seles in the final again), Amelia Island (defeating Graf in the final) and Hilton Head. She also reached the semifinal stage at three of the four grand slams:- the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon; and a quarterfinal at the US Open.
1993
At the Australian Open, Sabatini reached the semifinals, saving three match points in the quarterfinals against Mary Pierce to defeat her 4–6, 7–6, 6–0, before losing to eventual champion, Seles. She reached consecutive finals at the Italian Open and German Open during the clay-court season. At the French Open in June, Sabatini lost to Mary Jo Fernandez in the quarterfinals 8–10 in the final set, in what was – at the time – the third longest match in Open Era tennis, having led 5–1 in the second set.[14] Sabatini also reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, and at the US Open where she lost to Graf in three sets.
That year in May, following the stabbing attack of Monica Seles in the WTA Hamburg tournament, a vote among the top players was held by the tour organisers to decide whether Seles should be allowed to have her world no. 1 ranking protected while recovering from the knife attack. Of the 17 players voting, all players voted against protecting Seles' ranking, apart from Sabatini (who abstained).[15][16] Despite the vote result, Seles was eventually granted a joint No. 1 ranking (with Graf) upon her return to the tour two years later.[17]
1994: WTA Finals champion
In 1994, Sabatini reached the finals of Amelia Island and Strasbourg, and the semifinals of both the Australian Open and US Open. Across 15 consecutive Grand Slam events from Wimbledon 1990 to Australian Open 1994, she did not lose before the quarterfinal stage; this was the third longest streak of consecutive quarterfinal Grand Slam appearances in women's tennis ever (behind Graf and Navratilova tied on 19). In November, Sabatini defeated Lindsay Davenport in the final of the WTA Championships in New York to win her second title at that tournament. In the first round, she beat world No. 6, Martina Navratilova, in what was Navratilova's last match before retirement.
1995
Sabatini won the title at the Sydney International, defeating Davenport in the final in straight sets. As well as the reaching a record seventh final in the Amelia Island Championships and her third final at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, she also reached the quarterfinals of both the French Open and Wimbledon, and the semifinals of the US Open (where she lost to eventual champion Graf 4–6, 6–7). Their semifinal was the 40th and final match between the pair, in which Graf led 29–11. Sabatini's 11 wins meant she had defeated Graf more times than any other player ever managed to defeat her.

James Britt Donovan (February 29, 1916 – January 19, 1970)[2][3] was an American lawyer and United States Navy officer in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency), ultimately becoming General Counsel of the OSS, and an international diplomatic negotiator.[4]
Donovan is widely known for negotiating the 1960–1962 exchange of captured American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, and for negotiating the 1962 release and return of 9,703 prisoners held by Cuba after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[5][6] Donovan was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the 2015 feature film Bridge of Spies.
Early life and early career
James Britt Donovan was born on February 29, 1916, in the Bronx to Harriet (née O'Connor), a piano teacher, and John J. Donovan, a surgeon. His brother was New York state senator John J. Donovan Jr. Both sides of the family were of Irish descent. He attended the Catholic All Hallows Institute. In 1933, he began his studies at Fordham University, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1937. He wanted to become a journalist but his father convinced him to study law at Harvard Law School, beginning in autumn of 1937, where he completed his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1940.[5]
After graduating from law school, Donovan started work at a private lawyer's office. He was a commander in the Navy during World War II. In 1942, he became associate general counsel at the Office of Scientific Research and Development. From 1943 to 1945, he was general counsel at the Office of Strategic Services. In 1945, he became assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson at the Nuremberg trials in Germany.[7]
Donovan was the presenter of visual evidence at the trial. While he prepared for the trials he also worked as an advisor for the documentary feature The Nazi Plan.
In 1950, Donovan became a partner in the New York-based law office of Watters and Donovan, specializing in insurance law.[4]
Release of Gary Powers
In 1957, Donovan defended the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in what was known as the Hollow Nickel Case after many other lawyers refused.[9] He later brought in Thomas M. Debevoise to assist him.[10] Abel was convicted at trial, but Donovan was successful in persuading the court not to impose a death sentence. He appealed Abel's case to the Supreme Court, which in Abel v. United States was rejected by a 5–4 vote.  Donovan's argument was that evidence used against his client had been seized by the FBI in violation of the Fourth Amendment.[11] Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren praised him and publicly expressed the "gratitude of the entire court" for his taking the case.[9]
In 1962, Donovan, who was lead negotiator, and CIA lawyer Milan C. Miskovsky[12] negotiated with Soviet mediators to free captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Donovan successfully negotiated for the exchange of Powers, along with American student Frederic Pryor, for the still-imprisoned Rudolf Abel, whom Donovan had defended five years earlier.[13]
This negotiation and preceding events were dramatized by the 2015 historical thriller Bridge of Spies, by Steven Spielberg.
Involvement in Cuba
In June 1962, Donovan was contacted by Cuban exile Pérez Cisneros, who asked him to support the negotiations to free the 1,113[14] prisoners of the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[6][15] Donovan offered pro bono legal service for the Cuban Families Committee of prisoners' relatives.[15] A few months later, he traveled to Cuba for the first time. Donovan managed to create confidence with Castro, who was pleased that Donovan's teenage son traveled with him to Cuba.[6]
On December 21, 1962, Castro and Donovan signed an agreement to exchange all 1,113 prisoners for $53 million in food and medicine,[14] sourced from private donations and from companies expecting tax concessions.[13] Donovan had the idea to exchange the prisoners for medicine after he had found out that the Cuban medicine didn't help him with his own bursitis.[16] By the end of the negotiations, July 3, 1963, Donovan had secured the release of 9,703 men, women and children from Cuban detention.[17] Donovan was once again teamed up with CIA lawyer Milan C. Miskovsky on these negotiations.[12] For his work, Donovan received the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.
Later life and death
From 1961 to 1963, Donovan was vice president of the New York Board of Education, and from 1963 until 1965, he was the president of the board. In June 1962, his alma mater Fordham presented Donovan with an honorary degree. In 1962, he was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in New York but lost in November 1962 to Republican incumbent Jacob K. Javits.[18] In 1968, Donovan was appointed president of Pratt Institute. He died of a heart attack on January 19, 1970, in Brooklyn's Methodist Hospital in New York, after being treated for influenza.[19]

In 1941, Donovan married Mary E. McKenna, who was also an Irish American. The couple had a son and three daughters, and lived in Brooklyn, New York, while also maintaining seasonal residences in Spring Lake on the Jersey Shore, New Jersey, and Lake Placid, New York State, where Donovan is buried alongside his wife and daughter. He was a rare book collector, golfer, tennis player and gin rummy player. A collection of his papers is held at Stanford University's Hoover Library & Archives.
In popular culture
The story of the Abel trial and defense, followed by the negotiation and prisoner exchange, was the basis for the book Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel and Francis Gary Powers, written by Donovan and ghost writer Bard Lindeman, which was published in 1964.[5] Several similar works would come later, but Strangers was the definitive work and was widely critically acclaimed.[20][21] The book was re-released by Simon & Schuster in August 2015.[20][22] In 1967, Donovan published his second book, Challenges: Reflections of a Lawyer-at-Large.
James Gregory played Donovan in the 1976 TV movie Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident, based on Powers' biography (written with Curt Gentry). Lee Majors played Powers.[23] In 2006, Philip J. Bigger published a biography of Donovan, Negotiator: The Life and Career of James B. Donovan.,[5] which was re-released in paperback in January 2017.
Though not officially the basis for the movie Bridge of Spies, Donovan's Strangers on a Bridge is the closest, and is the only first-hand narrative to the dramatic events in the Oscar-winning movie. The 1964 New York Times Best Seller repeated itself in 2015, becoming #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for espionage books. The book has been widely acclaimed, including by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. The re-issue coincided with the pre-release promotion for the movie, directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, which was released on October 16, 2015. Tom Hanks plays the role of Donovan, with Amy Ryan as his wife, Mary.[24]
Honors
In October 2016, Fordham University inducted Donovan into its Hall of Honor [25] in conjunction with its Dodransbicentennial, the 175th anniversary of the school, in a mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who was also named a founder of the school. Fordham was founded by Archbishop Hughes, who is an ancestor of Donovan.[4] Also in October 2016, Donovan was inducted into the All Hallows School Hall of Fame.[26]

Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker (Spanish pronunciation: [roˈβeɾto enˈrike kleˈmente (ɣ)walˈkeɾ];[a] August 18, 1934 – December 31, 1972) was a Puerto Rican professional baseball player who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, primarily as a right fielder. After his early and sudden death, the National Baseball Hall of Fame changed its rules so that a player who had been dead for at least six months would be eligible for entry. In 1973 Clemente was posthumously inducted, becoming the first Caribbean and the first Latin-American player to be honored in the Hall of Fame.
Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion. Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971).
Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries during the off-seasons. He often delivered baseball equipment and food to those in need. In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. The following season, the Pirates retired his uniform number 21, and MLB renamed its annual Commissioner's Award in his honor. Now known as the Roberto Clemente Award, it is given to the player who "best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team."
Early life
Clemente was born on August 18, 1934, in Barrio San Antón in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Luisa Walker and Melchor Clemente. He was the youngest of seven siblings (three were from his mother's previous marriage). During Clemente's childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality, located in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family's resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks. As a youth, Clemente was a track and field star and Olympic hopeful before deciding to turn his attention to baseball.[3]
Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. When he was fourteen, he was recruited by Roberto Marín to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Antón. He was with the team two years as a shortstop.[4]
He attended Julio Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina where also participated in the high jump and javelin throw and was considered good enough to represent Puerto Rico at the Olympics. He later stated that throwing the javelin helped in strengthening his arm and with his footwork and release.[5] Despite his all-around athletic skill, however, Clemente decided to focus on baseball and went on to join Puerto Rico's amateur league, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.[6]
Professional career
Puerto Rican baseball (1952–1954)
Clemente's professional career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedrín Zorilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce ("Crabbers"), a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR). Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros' starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team's leadoff hitter.[7]
While Clemente was playing in the Puerto Rican League, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract of $15,000 – $10,000 bonus and $5000 league minimum salary. Clemente signed with them on February 19, 1954.[8]
Minor league baseball (1954)
At the time of Clemente's signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($52,000 today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons and failure to comply with the rule would result in the team losing the rights to that player's contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire.[9]
As Clemente's bonus was larger than $4,000, he was considered a bonus baby. However, the Dodgers decided against benching him for two years in the majors and decided to place him with the Montreal Royals, their International League Triple-A affiliate. While it is often believed that the Dodgers instructed manager Max Macon to use Clemente sparingly to prevent him from being drafted under the Rule 5 Draft, Macon himself denied it. Box scores also suggest that Macon platooned Clemente the same as he did with other outfielders.[10]
Affected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black.[b]
Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' scouting trip to Richmond on June 1, 1954. Noticing Clemente in batting practice, Pirates scout Clyde Sukeforth made inquiries and soon learned about Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby.[12] Twelve years later, manager Macon acknowledged that "we tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn't work" but denied being instructed to not play Clemente, stating that the player needed time to develop and was struggling against Triple-A pitching.[13] However, Pittsburgh noticed his raw talents; as Sukeforth recalled years later, "I knew then he'd be our first draft choice. I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of 'our boy' and see that he didn't get hurt."[14]
In 87 games with the Royals, Clemente hit .257 with two home runs.[15] The first home run of his North American baseball career came on July 25, 1954; Clemente's extra inning, walk-off home run was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement. His only other minor league home run came on September 5. On his 20th birthday, August 8, he made a notable game-ending outfield assist, cutting down the potential tying run at the plate.[16]
While Clemente returned to Puerto Rico to play in winter ball, Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi went to Pirates GM Branch Rickey, under whom Bavasi had worked when the latter ran the Dodgers before departing to work for the Pirates, in a final attempt to dissuade him from drafting Clemente. Bavasi recalled years later that after he declined Rickey's offer to join him, Rickey had promised him that, "Should I need help at anytime, all I had to do was pick up the phone." He used this offer to get Rickey to agree draft Royals' pitcher Johnny Rutherford in place of Clemente. A few days later, however, Bavasi discovered that the deal was off due to a heated argument between Rickey and Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley: "Walter and Mr. Rickey got in another argument and it seems Walter called Mr. Rickey every name in the book. Thus, we lost Roberto."[17]
At the end of the season, Clemente returned to play for Santurce where one of his teammates was Willie Mays.[18][19] While with the team, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954.[20]
Major League Baseball (1955–1972)
For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters.[21] For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente.[22]
During the off-seasons (except the 1958–59, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1968–69, 1971–72, and 1972–73 seasons), Clemente played professionally for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, Criollos de Caguas, and Senadores de San Juan in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team.
In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion.[23] The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles, caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, disappeared as a result of the training. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964.[24][25][26]
Early years
The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948.
Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying "I don't believe in color." He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity.
Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of partially African descent. The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts, their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line by joining the Dodgers.[27] When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area.[28]
During his rookie season, Clemente had to si

Robert Louis Stevenson (born Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson; 13 November 1850 – 3 December 1894) was a Scottish novelist, essayist, poet and travel writer. He is best known for works such as Treasure Island, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Kidnapped and A Child's Garden of Verses.
Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from Andrew Lang, Edmund Gosse,[1] Leslie Stephen and W. E. Henley, the last of whom may have provided the model for Long John Silver in Treasure Island. In 1890, he settled in Samoa where, alarmed at increasing European and American influence in the South Sea islands, his writing turned from romance and adventure fiction toward a darker realism. He died of a stroke in his island home in 1894 at age 44.[2]
A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevenson's critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim. In 2018, he was ranked just behind Charles Dickens as the 26th-most-translated author in the world.[3]
Family and education
Childhood and youth
Stevenson was born at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to Thomas Stevenson (1818–1887), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Isabella (born Balfour, 1829–1897). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of "Lewis" to "Louis", and he dropped "Balfour" in 1873.[4][5]
Lighthouse design was the family's profession; Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the civil engineer Robert Stevenson, and Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David were in the same field.[6] Thomas's maternal grandfather Thomas Smith had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour, who had held the lands of Inchrye in Fife in the fifteenth century.[7] His mother's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton,[8] and her siblings included physician George William Balfour and marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. "Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister," Stevenson wrote. "I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them."[9]
Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851.[10] The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin.[11] Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis[12] or sarcoidosis.[13] The family also summered in the spa town of Bridge of Allan, in North Berwick, and in Peebles for the sake of Stevenson's and his mother's health; "Stevenson's cave" in Bridge of Allan was reportedly the inspiration for the character Ben Gunn's cave dwelling in Stevenson's 1883 novel Treasure Island.[14]
"My second mother, my first wife. The angel of my infant life— From the sick child, now well and old, Take, nurse, the little book you hold!" ⁠Dedication of "A Child's Garden of Verses": ⁠⁠"To Alison Cunningham. From her Boy."[15]
Stevenson's parents were both devout Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse Alison Cunningham (known as Cummy)[16] was more fervently religious. Her mix of Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion.[17] But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from John Bunyan and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the Covenanters. Stevenson recalled this time of sickness in "The Land of Counterpane" in A Child's Garden of Verses (1885),[18] dedicating the book to his nurse.[19]
Stevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the Edinburgh Academy; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at Colinton.[20] His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse,[21] and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father had found them and had told him to "give up such nonsense and mind your business."[6] He paid for the printing of Robert's first publication at 16, entitled The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666. It was an account of the Covenanters' rebellion and was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event.[22]
Education
In September 1857, when he was six years old, Stevenson went to Mr Henderson's School in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859, aged eight. During his many absences, he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, aged ten, he went to Edinburgh Academy, an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in Isleworth in Middlesex (now an urban area of West London). In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, the 13-year-old was sent to Robert Thomson's private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university.[23] In November 1867, Stevenson entered the University of Edinburgh to study engineering. From the start he showed no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in The Speculative Society (an exclusive debating club), particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevenson's financial agent, and with a professor, Fleeming Jenkin, whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write.[24] Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (known as "Bob"), a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art.[25]
Holidays in Swanston
In 1867, Stevenson's family took a lease on Swanston Cottage, in the village of Swanston at the foot of the Pentland Hills, for use as a summer holiday home. They held the lease until 1880. During their tenancy, the young Robert Louis made frequent use of the cottage, being attracted by the quiet country life and the feeling of remoteness. It is likely that the time he spent there influenced his later writing as well as his wider outlook on life, particularly his love of nature and of wild places. The house and its romantic location are thought to have inspired several of his works.[26][27]
Lighthouse inspections
Each year during the holidays, Stevenson also travelled to inspect the family's engineering works: to Anstruther and Wick in 1868; with his father on his official tour of Orkney and Shetland islands lighthouses in 1869; and for three weeks to the island of Erraid in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of Walter Scott with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scott's 1822 novel The Pirate.[28] In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevenson's mother reported that he was "wonderfully resigned" to his son's choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read law (again at Edinburgh University) and be called to the Scottish bar.[29] In his 1887 poetry collection Underwoods, Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession:[30]
Rejection of church dogma
In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more Bohemian; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress.[31] Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels.[32] More significantly, he had come to reject Christianity and declared himself an atheist.[33] In January 1873, when he was 22, his father came across the constitution of the LJR (Liberty, Justice, Reverence) Club, of which Stevenson and his cousin Bob were members, which began: "Disregard everything our parents have taught us". Questioning his son about his beliefs, he discovered the truth.[34] Stevenson no longer believed in God and had grown tired of pretending to be something he was not: "am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?" His father professed himself devastated: "You have rendered my whole life a failure." His mother accounted the revelation "the heaviest affliction" to befall her. "O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is", Stevenson wrote to his friend Charles Baxter, "to have just damned the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world."[35]
Stevenson's rejection of the Presbyterian Church and Christian dogma, however, did not turn into lifelong atheism or agnosticism. On February 15, 1878, the 27-year-old wrote to his father and stated:[36]
Christianity is among other things, a very wise, noble and strange doctrine of life ... You see, I speak of it as a doctrine of life, and as a wisdom for this world ... I have a good heart, and believe in myself and my fellow-men and the God who made us all ... There is a fine text in the Bible, I don't know where, to the effect that all things work together for good for those who love the Lord. Strange as it may seem to you, everything has been, in one way or the other, bringing me nearer to what I think you would like me to b

José Luis Sánchez del Río (March 28, 1913 – February 10, 1928) was a Mexican Cristero who was put to death by government officials because he refused to renounce his Catholic faith. His death was seen as a largely political venture on the part of government officials in their attempt to stamp out dissent and crush religious freedom in the area. He was dubbed "Joselito."
Ngô Đình Diệm(Buddhist crisis, Huế Phật Đản shootings, Huế chemical attacks, Double Seven Day scuffle, Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, 1963 South Vietnamese coup, arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm)
He was declared to be venerable on June 22, 2004, by Pope John Paul II and was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI – through the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints – on November 20, 2005, in Mexico. Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him on January 21, 2016, allowing for his canonization to take place; a date was determined at a consistory on March 15, 2016, and he was canonized a saint on October 16, 2016.
Background
The Cristero War began when the government began eliminating church privileges and seizing church properties throughout the country, in accordance with anti-clerical laws written into the Mexican Constitution. President Plutarco Elias Calles, who took office in 1924, focused on the Roman Catholic Church, which led to seizure of church property, the closing of religious schools and convents, and the exile or the execution of priests.[1]
Life and Cristero War
José Luis Sánchez del Río was born on March 28, 1913,[3] in Sahuayo, Michoacán. He attended school first in his hometown, then in Guadalajara in Jalisco.
When the Cristero War broke out in 1926, his brothers joined the rebel forces, but his mother would not allow him to take part. The rebel general, Prudencio Mendoza Alcazar, also refused his enlistment. The boy insisted that he wanted the chance to give his life for Jesus Christ and so come to Heaven easily. Mendoza relented and allowed José to become the flagbearer of the troop.[4] The Cristeros nicknamed him Tarcisius, after the early Christian saint who was martyred for protecting the Eucharist from desecration.
During heavy fighting on January 25, 1928, a soldier named Mendoza had his horse killed and José gave his horse to the man so that he could flee.[4] Then he sought cover and fired at the enemy until he ran out of ammunition. The government troops captured the boy and imprisoned him.
Torture and death
It was later reported that José was captured by government forces, who ordered him to renounce his faith in Christ, under threat of death. He refused to accept apostasy.[3]
To break his resolve, he was made to watch the hanging of another Cristero that they had in custody, but instead José encouraged the man, saying that they would soon meet again in Heaven after death.[4] In prison, José prayed the Rosary daily and wrote an emotional letter to his mother, saying that he was ready to fulfill the will of God to whom he dedicated himself. His father attempted to raise a ransom to save him, but was not able to appease the government in time to do so, thus failing to secure the release of his son.
Others recalled the gruesome events that transpired after the government's failure to break José's resolve on the evening of February 10, 1928: "Consequently they cut the bottom of his feet and obliged him to walk around the town toward the cemetery. They also at times cut him with a machete until he was bleeding from several wounds. He cried and moaned with pain, but he did not give in. At times they stopped him and said, 'If you shout, "Death to Christ the King" we will spare your life'. José would only shout, 'I will never give in. Viva Cristo Rey!'"[3]
Burial and relics
The remains of José Luis Sánchez del Río are enshrined above a side altar in the Church of Saint James the Apostle in Sahuayo, his hometown.[5]
Sainthood
The sainthood proceedings opened in Zamora on May 1, 1996 in a diocesan process that continued until October 25, 1996. A week prior to the conclusion of that phase the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared "nihil obstat" (nothing against) to the cause on October 21, 1996; this granted him the title Servant of God, the first stage in the sainthood process. The process was later ratified on November 29, 2002, and allowed for officials to draft and submit in 2003 the Positio on his martyrdom.
Pope John Paul II approved the findings on June 22, 2004, thus allowing his beatification. He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on November 20, 2005, in Mexico; the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints presided on behalf of the pontiff.
The miracle needed for his canonization attributed to José Luis Sánchez del Río the inexplicable recovery of a baby in Mexico who doctors said had "no hope of survival", 2008–2009. It was investigated on a local level in Mexico and concluded its work on January 30, 2015. A medical board approved it in 2015 while theologians did so as well on October 8, 2015; the C.C.S. granted final approval on January 12, 2016, before submitting it to the pope for his approval.[6]
Pope Francis approved the miracle as being directly attributed to his intercession on January 21, 2016, and the pope confirmed at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on March 15, 2016, the date of which he would be elevated to sainthood. He was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on October 16, 2016.[7][8]
Legacy
The "Blessed José Sánchez del Río High School Seminary" was established in 2008 in Mankato, Minnesota by Father Carlos Miguel Buela of the Institute of the Incarnate Word (IVE) (Spanish: Instituto del Verbo Encarnado), a Roman Catholic religious institute.

Tōru Muranishi村西 とおるBornHiromi Kusano (草野 博美, Kusano Hiromi) (1948-09-09) 9 September 1948 (age 75)Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, JapanNationalityJapaneseAlma materFukushima Prefectural Nakoso Technical High SchoolOccupation(s)Film directorActorEntrepreneurYears active1984–presentWebsitehttp://muranishitoru.com/
Toru Muranishi (村西とおる, Muranishi Tōru, born 9 September 1948) is an innovative and controversial director of Japanese adult videos (AV). Known in Japan as the "Emperor of Porn",[1] he has been credited as one of the creators of the quasi-documentary style found in Japanese AVs, a genre which has remained popular throughout the history of the adult industry in Japan.[2] 
He was called "the dirtiest of the industry’s dirty old men" in a 1992 Tokyo Journal article by Kjell Fornander.[3]
Life and career
Toru Muranishi was born in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. After graduating high school, Muranishi moved to Tokyo where he sold encyclopedias. He subsequently became involved in book publishing and the entertainment industry.[4]
Crystal-Eizou
Muranishi joined the newly formed AV studio Crystal-Eizou in late 1984 and began directing films with them soon afterwards.[5] Muranishi is given credit for launching the career of one of the first AV superstars, Kaoru Kuroki[3] who made her debut at Crystal-Eizou in October 1986.[6] Among Muranishi's pioneering developments at Crystal-Eizou were his Face Shower (顔面シャワー, Ganmen Shawā) series which culminated in a facial, the Fuck Lunch (駅弁ファック, Ekiben Fakku) series which satirized contemporary food-oriented TV programs, and the Conch Shell (ホラ貝, Hora Kai) videos where the actress would blow into a conch shell (as in some Buddhist rituals) to signify that she had reached an orgasm.[5][7]
Muranishi has had numerous problems with the law in his career, having been convicted seven times of criminal violations.[4][5] While at Crystal-Eizou, in June 1986, Muranishi was arrested for violating the Japanese Child Welfare Act (児童福祉法, Jidō Fukushi Hō) by using an underage actress in videos.[6] Later that same year Muranishi brought a staff to Hawaii in a "legendary session" where he filmed 30 videos in 30 days.[3] Muranishi flew in 15 or so actresses in turn from Japan for the shooting[3] and in December 1986 was arrested in Hawaii for passport violations and was indicted under the Mann Act. He was released in July of the next year.[6] Muranishi was once again arrested and fined for using a 17-year-old actress in August 1988.[8]
Diamond Visual
In September 1988 Muranishi left Crystal-Eizou to form his own company, Diamond Visual (ダイヤモンド映像, Daiyamondo Eizō).[5][8] According to Kjell Fornander, Diamond Visual was "a video giant which took porn to new limits and often beyond them".[3] His Crystal-Eizou star Kaoru Kuroki also worked with him at Diamond Visual[9] and in February 1989, a new star, Kimiko Matsuzaka, debuted with the company.[10] Matsuzaka and her large bust led to a "Big Bust" boom in Japanese AV and helped assure the success of Diamond Visual.[11] In the early 1990s Diamond Visual was "AV’s largest production company"[3] and Muranishi has said that the company had annual sales of 10 billion yen (about $80 million).[4] Muranishi also ventured into the softcore field of pink film and directed the December 1990 release Daikyonyuu: Noshikakaru (大巨乳　のしかかる) for Xces featuring his two stars from Diamond Visual, Kaoru Kuroki and Kimiko Matsuzaka.[12] The next year, he wrote the screenplay for another Matsuzaka vehicle, Daikyonyuu: Kaikan Shibori (大巨乳　快感絞り), released in March 1991 by Xces.[13] Despite its popularity, Diamond Visual went bankrupt in 1992 with debts of 5 billion yen (about $40 million) and Muranishi had to greatly alter his style of living, going from a luxury home and Rolls-Royce to barely being able to afford an apartment.[3][4][5]
Later career
Muranishi, who claims to have had sex with 7,000 women and produced some 3,000 adult videos,[4] remained in the adult entertainment industry after the collapse of Diamond Visual and soon was broadcasting on his own satellite TV channel, producing about 15 movies a month with himself as producer, director, cameraman and star.[14] That enterprise also collapsed and Muranishi once again ended up in debt.[1]
Muranishi was the subject of a British Channel 4 TV documentary The Sex Shogun of Shinjuku, part of the 1995 Without Walls Special series. The program explored "the exploits of leading Japanese pornographer Touru Muranishi" and looked at the documentary porn genre with "real sex with real women in real places".[14][15] The program was later released (in 1997) in VHS format with another program as Red Light Zone.[16]
As an actor, Muranishi appeared in the 2000 Soft On Demand (SOD) produced V-Cinema Renshin Joshikousei Patty (恋身女子校生パティ} which starred SOD's leading actress Kurumi Morishita.[17]
Muranishi is also a prolific writer both online and in print. He has contributed to a blog on Japanese AV supplier DMM's website,[18] another blog on his own website,[19] and a series of articles going back to 2005.[20] He has also published a number of books[21] including Toru Muranishi's Grade Book (村西とおるの閻魔帳), a 400-page collection of material from his blogs published by Cosmos Books (コスモの本) in March 2010 (ISBN 4906380905).[5]
In February and March 2007, Takara Visual issued a four volume collection of Muranishi's works from 1999 to 2001.[22]
Muranishi was the subject of a documentary film Toru Muranishi: It Is Nice by Akira Takatsuki which was screened at the New Directors Film Festival in Tokyo in November 2014. The film, which took its name from one of Muranishi's early videos for Crystal-Eizou, won a special award at the festival.[1]
Muranishi also was the basis for the semi-biographical series The Naked Director which premiered on Netflix on 8 August 2019. Muranishi was played by actor Takayuki Yamada. On 15 August 2019, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.[23][24][25] On 24 June 2021 Netflix released the second season of The Naked Director, with no plans for a third season in the foreseeable future.[26][27]

Sampdoria
On 11 January 2011, Sampdoria confirmed Icardi had signed with the club on loan[12] until the end of the season. After a successful six-month loan for la Samp, scoring 13 goals in 19 games with the Primavera team, the Italian side utilised the option to buy Icardi for €400,000 in July 2011, signing a three-year deal.[12][13] In 2011–12 season, he scored 19 goals in the reserve league Group A, as the joint-third topscorer of the league along with Gonzalo Barreto of Group C.
On 12 May 2012, he made his first-team debut, against Juve Stabia, after coming off the bench to replace Bruno Fornaroli in the 75th minute of the match. Ten minutes later, Icardi scored his first professional goal to win the match 2–1 for Sampdoria.[14]

On 25 August 2013, Icardi made his Inter official debut, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 home success over Genoa, hitting the crossbar late in the game;[30] he scored his first league goal for the Nerazzurri on 14 September, netting the first of a 1–1 home draw against Juventus, after coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute.[31]
Due to injury, Icardi missed most of the games of the first part of the season,[32] only returning to first-team matches in February. On 14 February 2014, during the away match against Fiorentina at Stadio Artemio Franchi, Icardi returned in the field after four months and scored the winner after only ten minutes.[33] Later, on 5 April, Icardi scored a brace during the 2–2 home draw against Bologna.[34] That was his first brace of his Inter career. This was followed by another brace during the 0–4 away win against his former side Sampdoria.[35] Before the match, he was booed by the home fans, but he quieted them down by scoring in the 13th minute from a cross from Palacio, making a negative gesture which saw him booked.[36]
On 10 May 2014, in Javier Zanetti's last competitive match at the San Siro, in which Inter defeated Lazio 4–1 to secure a place in Europa League play-off for next season, Icardi scored the second goal of the match in the 37th minute after an assist from Kovačić and went to celebrate with Zanetti.[37] He ended his first season with Nerazzurri with 23 matches in all competitions, including 22 in the league, scoring 9 goals in the process with an average of one goal in every 145 minutes.
On 10 June 2014, Inter and Sampdoria reached the deal to terminate the co-ownership for another €6.5 million,[23] making Inter was the sole employer of Icardi in the football field.[38]
On 20 August 2014, in Inter's first match of the season against Iceland's Stjarnan for first leg of play-off round of the 2014–15 Europa League, Icardi opened a 3–0 away win.[39] That was his first European goal, in his European debut. In the returning leg, he came in as a second-half substitute and scored two times in a 6–0 win at the San Siro, to advance his team into the group stage 9–0 on aggregate.[citation needed]
During the second match of the league season on 14 September, he scored his second Serie A hat-trick in a 7–0 thrashing of Sassuolo.[40] Ten days later, Icardi was injured and substituted in the 24th minute for Dani Osvaldo during the 2–0 home win against Atalanta.[41] On 26 October, Icardi netted his first Serie A goal for over a month, the winner on a penalty kick against Cesena and giving Inter their first away win of the league.[42] He was decisive again three days later, scoring a 90th-minute penalty kick won by Zdravko Kuzmanović in a 1–0 win against Sampdoria, giving his former side their first loss of 2014–15 season.[43]
On 9 November, Icardi scored twice after two assists by Palacio during a 2–2 home draw against Hellas Verona.[44] This draw caused the sacking of coach Walter Mazzarri, who was replaced with the returning Roberto Mancini.[45] On 6 January of the following year, in the first match of the second part of the season, Icardi netted the only goal for his team during the 1–1 draw against Juventus at Juventus Stadium; the goal came in 64th minute after a pass from the Colombian midfielder Fredy Guarín.[46] During that match, he had a conflict with his strike partner Osvaldo who was angry with him after Icardi decided to shoot instead of passing to his teammate who was in a better position to score.[47] Due to this, Osvaldo left the team in the end of January.[citation needed] Five days later, Icardi was decisive in Inter's 3–1 home win against Genoa, scoring the second goal and earlier making an overhead kick (saved by goalkeeper) which was turned into an assist for Palacio.[48]
In the match against Sassuolo, Inter lost 1–3 with Icardi scoring the only goal for his team after a mistake from the Sassuolo defence. After the match, he along with Guarín had a conflict with the fans at the Mapei Stadium. They went to throw their shirt to the fans who refused and threw them back at them, spewing insults at them.[49] On 7 February, Icardi responded by scoring twice in a 3–0 home win against Palermo, refusing to celebrate in the process.[50] After the match Icardi told to the media that the reason he did not celebrate was not the conflict with the fans but failing to find a way to renew his contract with the club directors. He was later criticized by Mancini for not celebrating.[51]
On 11 April, he scored the first goal during the 0–3 away win against Verona, helping Inter get their first win after six consecutive matches.[52] He scored twice on the final day in a 4–3 win over Empoli and finished the season as the joint Serie A top goalscorer with 22 goals with Verona's Luca Toni.[53] Although Inter failed to qualify for European competition for the second time since 1999, Icardi's form attracted attention from abroad, however he signed a new four-year contract at the season's end.[54]
2015–2017: Captaincy and controversy
Before the start of 2015–16 season, it was announced that Icardi would be the new captain of Inter, replacing Andrea Ranocchia who lost his status after a poor 2014–15 season.[5] In his first match as skipper, he was taken off after 15 minutes during the league win against Atalanta; Icardi was substituted for Stevan Jovetić, who scored the winning goal in the third minute of added time.

Biography
Personal life
Cheney[1] was born on 2 January 1975 and grew up in Wheelers Hill, an outer-eastern suburb of Melbourne.[2] His father is Noel Cheney.[3] At the age of five years, he saw his first rock performance at VFL Park, which was close to his home, it was a gig by the American rock band, Kiss.[2] He attended Jells Park Primary School in between 1981 and 1987 and then Wheelers Hill Secondary College. He later studied Jazz at Box Hill Institute of TAFE between 1994 and 1995. Cheney started playing the guitar at the age of six he taught himself how to play by listening to AC/DC cassette tapes over and over and practising what he heard. His major influence was Brian Setzer (Stray Cats), a guitarist and singer-songwriter.[4]
On 22 September 2001, Cheney was injured in a car crash where his right leg was crushed, which required surgery with a rod and three pins being inserted to stabilize the fracture. He was initially confined to bed and later used a walking stick for the next six months. He was unable to play the guitar until he was rehabilitated. His future wife, Emma, was also inside the vehicle, but escaped with only minor injuries.[5] Cheney eventually married Emma in 2005, they have two daughters: Charlie Bella (born 2006) and Scarlett Lyric (born 2008). In October 2010, Chris and Emma, along with his manager Rae Harvey and her partner Woody Annison, opened their own recording studio, Red Door Sounds.[6] On 25 April 2011, his father, Noel, died having been diagnosed with cancer the previous year.[3][7] Late that year, the Cheneys moved to live in Los Angeles, California. On their new life in L.A., Cheney remarked: "Both our littlies are in school here ... It's everyday life. You get up, mad rush in the morning, school drop-off, I come home, write a few songs, bum around and it's school pick-up again. It's life as we knew it, just in a different country".[8] In 2020, Cheney and his family relocated back to Melbourne due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9][10]
Music career
Cheney met Scott Owen at Jells Park Primary School and they began their career together in 1992, in a Melbourne band, The Runaway Boys, who took their name from a Stray Cats album, Runaway Boys – which Cheney cites as one of his favourites.[4] The group was a covers band playing Stray Cats and The Clash material.[11][12][13] In 1992, the group's first paying gig was at the Richmond Club Hotel and they soon followed with a residency at the nearby Corner Hotel.[2] The Runaway Boys had a succession of drummers, "The first two guys, Shane and Grant, were at high school with us and they were never really into 1950s rock'n'roll. We were probably a bit pushy at that point. Grant was happy to play along, but then when high school finished he was ready to move on and go to university".[2] Cheney also gigged on guitar in another band, Goodbye Sideburns Forever, though he was not recorded with them.[13]
The Living End
Cheney and Owen, on piano and bass, were in The Runaway Boys. In 1994, the pair started to write their own material and were joined by Joe Piripitzi on drums to form The Living End.[11][12] They released two successive extended plays, Hellbound (1995) and It's for Your Own Good (November 1996), which contained their first radio single, "From Here on In".[12] The track is co-written by Cheney and Owen.[14] In 1996 while Green Day were touring Australia, The Living End sent their second EP to the band, and supported them on their tour, which then led to radio station, Triple J, playing their first single. Late that year Piripitzi was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey.[2][12] In September 1997 The Living End issued a third EP, Second Solution / Prisoner of Society, with four of its five tracks written by Cheney.[12] The EP peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart.[15] It became the highest-selling Australian-made single for the 1990s.[11]
On 12 October 1998, they released their debut self-titled album, which reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart.[15] It included the singles "Save the Day" (September 1998), "Prisoner of Society" (September 1999), and "All Torn Down".[15] They have since received recognition worldwide, playing tours and festivals such as the Warped Tour in the United States and Reading and Leeds Festivals in the United Kingdom. Cheney wrote the group's other top 20 hits "Pictures in the Mirror" (2000), "Roll On" (2001), "One Said to the Other" (2003), "What's on Your Radio" (2005), and "Wake Up" (2006).
On 7 October 2006, Cheney told his fellow members of The Living End that he wished to leave the band.[16] He "found himself going through a personal and creative crisis ... For the first time he was now also experiencing writer's block".[11] However, the crisis passed and Cheney started writing again.[11][16] In February 2008, under the pseudonym Longnecks, the group trialled the new tracks.[16] In July, The Living End issued another top 20 single, "White Noise".[11][15] The related album of the same name followed later that month.[11][16] On 22 July 2011, they released their sixth studio album, The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating, which reached No. 3.[15][17]
Solo career
In March 2022, Cheney announced his debut solo album, The Storm before the Calm, to be released 17 June. Alongside the announcement was the release of its lead single "California" and its film clip directed by Nick McKinlay. Cheney would later release "Football Team" as the second single from the album. On 2 June, Cheney announced an Australian tour in support of his debut album, alongside the third single "Corner Shop", with a film clip directed by Sean McDonald.[10][9][18]

In July 2005, Cheney performed a duet with Sarah McLeod (The Superjesus) on her second solo single, "Private School Kid".[23] On 17 December that year, he joined Green Day on stage at the Docklands Stadium (Telstra Dome) to play "I Fought the Law". Cheney was not the Green Day bunny as was rumoured, it was Tré Cool, drummer for Green Day. Also in December, Cheney was a guest on SBS-TV's celebrity music trivia show, RocKwiz, with former Divinyls lead singer, Chrissy Amphlett – they performed "Stray Cat Blues" as a duet of The Rolling Stones' track.[24][25] At the 2006 Jack Awards, he played in another super group, The Wrongs. They performed a Rose Tattoo track, "Bad Boy for Love", as a tribute to Peter Wells, the band's guitarist.
In February 2009, Cheney made a guest appearance on stage with the Stray Cats on their Australian Farewell Tour.[26] He performed four songs alongside his childhood heroes, Brian Setzer, Lee Rocker, and Slim Jim Phantom.[26] In August that year, Cheney took part in a series of concerts around Australia along with Tim Rogers (You Am I), Jamieson (Grinspoon), and Josh Pyke to celebrate The Beatles' White Album by performing the work in its entirety.[27]
In 2010, Cheney made two solo recordings, "Distant Sun", a cover of Crowded House's track for a tribute album, He Will Have His Way in November; "Street Parade", a Christmas song, written by Cheney for a Christmas album by various artists, The Spirit of Christmas 2010.[1][11] His first work as a record producer was for Melbourne indie rockers, Celadore, in October 2011 with their EP, The Bright and Blue.[28] Also in October, Cheney was a guest on RocKwiz for a second time, he appeared with US-born rocker, Suzi Quatro – he performed "Heatwave" fronting the in-house band, RocKwiz Orkestra; and then "Stumblin' In" as a duet with Quatro.[29]

Hibo Wardere is a Somali-born campaigner against female genital mutilation (FGM), author, and public speaker. Born in Somalia, she moved to London, England when just a teenager in 1989, as a refugee fleeing the Somali Civil War. She currently resides in Walthamstow, London, where she worked as a mediator and a regular FGM educator for Waltham Forest Borough. Her testimonials and campaigning work have made her one of Britain's most prominent campaigners about FGM and she has appeared in numerous publications, including the Telegraph, the BBC, and The Guardian.
Early life
Hibo Wardere was born in Somalia. At the age of six, she was the victim of type 3 FGM, an event she has described as "being engulfed in pain from head to toe".[1][2] Every day for the next ten years, she sought answers from her mother, but was always denied a response. When Wardere was 16, she finally struck a deal with a relative, who promised to tell her everything about what happened after her wedding night. She was horrified by the revelations, and soon fled to London after the civil war broke out in the 1980s.
Activism
When she arrived in London, Wardere sought treatment for her wounds, but received little support from the NHS. Doctors failed to ask what had happened to her, and only rarely mentioned FGM on her medical files, even when she gave birth to her children.
Wardere eventually found the answers she was looking for at the library, where she read about female mutilation in a book.[3] Years later, when she was studying to become a teaching assistant, she opened up about her story in a homework essay.[4] The head of staff read her work and asked her to deliver a speech to 120 teachers, during which some realised that their students might have experienced the same trauma.[4] After reading Wardere's essay, school governor Clare Coghill booked Wardere appointments with other schools in the area.[4] Wardere has worked as a mediator and FGM educator since then, helping young students escape FGM.[4] She also delivers awareness raising sessions to doctors and the Police to assist in their understanding of FGM.[5]
Her testimonies have appeared in numerous publications, including the BBC, the Guardian and the Telegraph.[1][6]  Wardere has advised that as an FGM survivor, she is aware many other women who have undergone the practice feel too ashamed to speak out about their suffering.  Wardere is quoted as saying “It is a sexual abuse. It brings shame and rips women and girls of their dignity. It should be stopped".[7]
Wardere's main ambition for the future is to see Female Genital Mutilation eradicated in her lifetime.

Egon Rudi Ernst Krenz (German pronunciation: [ˈeːgɔn ˈkʁɛnts]; born 19 March 1937) is a German former politician who was the last Communist leader of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) during the Revolutions of 1989. He succeeded Erich Honecker as the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) but was forced to resign only weeks later when the Berlin Wall fell.[3]
Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of prominent positions in the SED. He was Honecker's deputy from 1984 until he succeeded him in 1989 amid protests against the regime. Krenz was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain the Communist regime's grip on power. The SED gave up its monopoly of power some weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Krenz was forced to resign shortly afterward. He was expelled from the SED's successor party on 21 January 1990.[4] In 2000, he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for manslaughter for his role in the Communist regime. After his release from prison in 2003, he retired to the small town of Dierhagen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. He remained on parole until the end of his sentence in 2006.[5] Together with Karel Urbánek from Czechoslovakia, Krenz is the last former General Secretary from the Eastern Bloc still alive.
Early years
Krenz was born to German parents in Kolberg, then part of Nazi Germany in what is now part of Poland.[6] His family resettled in Damgarten in 1945 during the mass repatriations and expulsions of Germans from Poland at the end of World War II.[7]
Political career in East Germany
Krenz in 2013, at a German-American evening at the U.S. Consulate General in Munich.
Trained as a teacher and working as a journalist early in his career, Krenz joined the Free German Youth (FDJ) in 1953, as a teenager and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1955.[8] After serving in the Volksarmee from 1959 to 1961, he rejoined the FDJ. He studied at a prestigious Communist Party staff school in Moscow for three years, became a nomenklatura member and obtained a social science degree by 1967. Throughout his career, Krenz held a number of posts in the SED and the communist government. He was leader of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation from 1971 to 1974, and became a member of the central committee of the party in 1973. He was also a member of the Volkskammer (East Germany's legislature) from 1971 to 1990, and a member of its presidium from 1971 to 1981. Between 1974 and 1983, he was leader of the communist youth movement, the Free German Youth. From 1981 to 1984 he was a member of the Council of State.
In 1983, he joined the Politburo and became the Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport of the Central Committee; the same position Honecker had held before becoming General Secretary.[9] He rose to supreme prominence when he became Honecker's deputy on the Council of State in 1984. Around the same time, he replaced Paul Verner as the unofficial number-two man in the SED leadership, thus making him the second-most powerful man in the country. Although he was the youngest member of the Politburo (and indeed, one of only two people elevated to full membership in that body from 1976 to 1984), speculation abounded that Honecker had tapped him as his heir apparent.[10]
Leader of the German Democratic Republic
Following popular protests against East Germany's communist government, the SED Politburo voted to remove Honecker on 18 October 1989, and Krenz was elected as the new General Secretary of the SED Central Committee. Krenz had been approached several months earlier about ousting Honecker, but was reluctant to move against a man he called "my foster father and political teacher". He was initially willing to wait until the seriously ill Honecker died, but by October was convinced that the situation was too grave to wait for what he had called "a biological solution".[11]
Despite many protests, the Volkskammer elected Krenz to both of Honecker's major state posts—Chairman of the Council of State and Chairman of the National Defence Council. The former post was equivalent to that of president, while the latter post made Krenz commander-in-chief of the National People's Army. For only the second time in the Volkskammer's forty-year history, the vote was not unanimous (the first was on the law on abortion); 26 deputies voted against and 26 abstained.
Krenz (left) officially congratulating Erich Mielke on behalf of the government on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Stasi in 1985. Behind Mielke are other high-ranking officials of the Stasi.
In his first address as leader, Krenz promised to blunt some of the harsher edges of Honecker's regime and promised democratic reforms. The speech was identical to the one he had given to a closed group of the SED Central Committee; he even addressed the national audience as "Genossen" (comrades)–a term reserved for members of the SED. The speech sounded formulaic, and few East Germans believed him.[12][11] For instance, they still remembered that after the Tiananmen Square massacre just months earlier, he had gone to China to thank Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the regime. In Honecker's resignation speech, he named Krenz as his successor, further conveying an impression of undemocratic intransigence.[13] For this and other reasons, Krenz was almost as detested as Honecker had been; one popular joke suggested that the only difference between them was that Krenz still had a gallbladder. Indeed, almost as soon as he took power, thousands of East Germans took to the streets to demand his resignation.[11]
Also on the same day he took office, Krenz received a top secret report from planning chief Gerhard Schürer that showed the depths of East Germany's economic crisis. It showed that East Germany did not have enough money to make payments on the massive foreign loans that propped up the economy, and it was now DM123 billion in debt. Although Krenz had been the number-two man in the administration, Honecker had kept the true state of the economy a secret from him. Krenz was forced to send Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski to beg West Germany for a short-term loan to make interest payments. However, West Germany was unwilling to even consider negotiations until the SED abandoned power and allowed free elections—something that Krenz was unwilling to concede.[11]
This was not the only evidence that Krenz did not intend to truly open up the regime. While publicly discussing such reforms as loosening travel restrictions,[14] he also personally ordered the rejection of the dissident group New Forum's application to become an approved organisation.[15] Ahead of the large Alexanderplatz demonstration on 4 November, he ordered the Stasi to prevent any unauthorised attempt to cross the border by "bodily violence".[16]
On 7 November, Krenz approved the resignation of Prime Minister Willi Stoph and his entire cabinet along with two-thirds of the Politburo. However, the Central Committee unanimously re-elected Krenz to the position of General Secretary. In a speech, Krenz attempted a reckoning with history, which also criticised his political mentor Honecker. Yet, by this stage, events were rapidly spiralling out of his control.
Despite promises of reform, public opposition to the regime continued to grow. In an attempt to stem the tide, Krenz authorised the reopening of the border with Czechoslovakia, which had been sealed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany.[17] The newly formed Politburo agreed to adopt new regulations for trips to the West by way of a Council of Ministers resolution.
Opening of the Berlin Wall
On 6 November, the Interior Ministry published a draft of new travel regulations. While branded as a major change, in truth the draft made only cosmetic changes to Honecker-era rules. While state offices were supposed to approve applications "quickly", it actually took up to 30 days to process applications for ordinary travel abroad and up to six months for emigration. Not only could applications be denied for the usual reasons (national security, public order, public health, public morals, etc.) but it made no guarantee that people travelling abroad would get access to foreign currency. The draft enraged ordinary citizens, and was denounced as "complete trash" by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper.[18]
In a case of particularly bad timing, the draft was published just days after the government allowed travel to Czechoslovakia to resume. This resulted in a flood of refugees crowding onto the steps of the West German embassy in Prague. The enraged Czec

Heinrich Harrer (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈhaʁɐ]; 6 July 1912 – 7 January 2006) was an Austrian mountaineer, explorer, writer, sportsman, geographer, and SS sergeant. He was a member of the four-man climbing team that made the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger, the "last problem" of the Alps. While on expedition in the Indian Himalayas, Harrer and his group were arrested by British forces because of the outbreak of World War II and he escaped to Tibet, staying there until 1951 and never seeing active combat. He wrote the books Seven Years in Tibet (1952) and The White Spider (1959).[1]
Early life
Heinrich Harrer was born 6 July 1912 in Hüttenberg, Austria, in the district of Sankt Veit an der Glan in the state of Carinthia. His father, Josef Harrer, was a postal worker. From 1933 to 1938, Harrer studied geography and sports at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz. Harrer became a member of the traditional student corporation ATV Graz.
In 1935, Harrer was designated to participate in the Alpine skiing competition at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Austrian Alpine skiing team, however, boycotted the event due to a conflict regarding the skiing instructors' status as professionals. As a result, Harrer did not participate.
In 1937, Harrer won the downhill event at the World Student Championships at Zell am See.[2]
Eiger North Face
Mountain climbing was Harrer's true passion. Knowing an extraordinary feat of climbing could win him a place on a Himalayan expedition, Harrer and a friend, Fritz Kasparek, resolved to be the first to climb the North Face of the Eiger (3,967 m, 13,025 ft) in Switzerland. The near vertical wall, with its ice-field known as The White Spider, had claimed several lives; and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it. Following his final university exams in July 1938, Harrer and Kasparek traveled to Kleine Scheidegg at the foot of the Eiger and set out on their climb. Halfway up the mountain, Harrer and Kasparek encountered another team making the attempt, Ludwig Vörg and Anderl Heckmair from Germany. The four decided to make the rest of the climb as a single team, with the experienced Heckmair leading.[2]
Throughout the climb, the four men were constantly threatened by snow avalanches and rock falls. They were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the White Spider on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon 24 July 1938.[3] This first ascent of the Eiger North Face was described by Italian climber Reinhold Messner as "a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the Face",[4] made headlines around the world,[5] and is recounted in Harrer's book The White Spider, published in 1959.
Nazi involvement
In 1996, ORF editor and filmmaker Gerald Lehner found in American archives the membership card of Harrer, who joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in October 1933. After the Anschluss of March 1938, as Germany annexed Austria, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 1 April. He held the rank of Oberscharführer (Sergeant), and on 1 May he became a member of the Nazi Party. After their ascent of the Eiger North Face, the four climbers were received by and photographed with Adolf Hitler. Harrer later said he wore his SS uniform only once, on the day of his marriage to Charlotte Wegener, daughter of the eminent explorer and scholar Alfred Wegener.[1] After returning to Europe in 1952, Harrer was cleared of any pre-war crimes and this was later supported by Simon Wiesenthal.[2] In his memoir, Beyond Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer called his involvement with the Nazi Party a mistake made in his youth, when he had not yet learned to think for himself.[6]
Internment in India
In 1939, Harrer joined a four-man expedition, led by Peter Aufschnaiter, to the Diamir Face of the Nanga Parbat with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable, the four mountaineers were in Karachi, India at the end of August, waiting for a freighter to take them home. The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig, and Hans Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia (Iran), but several hundred kilometres north-west of Karachi they were arrested by British soldiers as enemy aliens and escorted back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed. Two days later, war was declared, and on 3 September 1939 all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay. They considered escaping to Portuguese Goa, but when further transferred to Dehradun to be detained there for years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising, the final goal being the Japanese front in Burma or China.
Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re-captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29 April 1944, Harrer and six others, including Rolf Magener and Heins von Have (disguised as British officers), Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and Sattler (disguised as native Indian workers), walked out of the camp. Magener and von Have took the train to Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma.[7][8]
The others headed for the closest border via Landour. After Sattler gave up on 10 May, the remaining four entered Tibet on 17 May 1944, crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 m, 19,350 ft) and thereafter split into two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June, Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without visas for Tibet, Kopp also gave up and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to the British authorities within a few days).[8]
Seven years in Tibet
Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former's knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to Tibet's capital city, Lhasa, which they reached on 15 January 1946 (eight months after Nazi Germany's surrender), having crossed Western Tibet, the South-West with Gyirong County, and the Northern Changthang.
In 1948, Harrer became a salaried official of the Tibetan government, translating foreign news and acting as the Court photographer. Harrer first met the 14th Dalai Lama when he was summoned to the Potala Palace and asked to make a film about ice skating, which Harrer had introduced to Tibet.[8] Harrer built a cinema for him, with a projector run off a Jeep engine. Harrer soon became the Dalai Lama's tutor in English, geography, and some science, and Harrer was astonished at how fast his pupil absorbed the Western world's knowledge.[8] They shared the same birthday and a strong friendship developed between the two that would last the rest of Harrer's life.[10]
In 1952, Harrer returned to Austria where he documented his experiences in the books Seven Years in Tibet (1952) and Lost Lhasa (1953). Seven Years in Tibet was translated into 53 languages, and was a bestseller in the United States in 1954, selling three million copies.[1] The book was the basis of two films of the same title, the first in 1956 and the second in 1997, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer.[11]
Wherever I live, I shall feel homesick for Tibet. I often think I can still hear the cries of wild geese and cranes and the beating of their wings as they fly over Lhasa in the clear, cold moonlight. My heartfelt wish is that my story may create some understanding for a people whose will to live in peace and freedom has won so little sympathy from an indifferent world.[12]
Later adventures
Following his return from Tibet, Harrer settled down in Kitzbühel, Austria, and later in Liechtenstein. He took part in a number of ethnographic as well as mountaineering expeditions to Alaska, the Andes, and the Mountains of the Moon in central Africa. In 1953 he explored the source of the Amazon River and made a first ascent of Ausangate (6384 m). In 1954, some with German-American Fred Beckey, Harrer made the first ascents of Mount Deborah (3,761 m, 12,339 ft), Mount Hunter (4,442 m, 14,573 ft), and Mount Drum (3661 m), all in Alaska. In 1957, he explored the Congo River with the former king Leopold III of Belgium.
In February 1962, he was the leader of the team of four climbers who made the first ascent of the Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m, 16,024 ft; later named Puncak Jaya) on Papua, Indonesia (then Dutch New Guinea), the highest peak in Oceania and one of the Seven Summits. This and his pioneering expedition to reach the Neolithic stone axe quarries at Ya-Li-Me are recorded in his memoir I Come from the Stone Age.
In 1966, he met the Xingu Indians of Brazil's Mato Grosso. In 1972, Harrer crossed the island of Borneo. He also made expeditions to Nepal, French Guiana, Greenland, Sudan, India, Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Uganda, Kenya and Bhutan.[13]
Harrer wrote more than 20 books about his adventures, some including photographs considered to be among the best records of traditional Tibetan culture. Harrer was also an excellent golfer, winning Austrian national championships in 1958 and 1970.[2]
Private life
In December 1938, Harrer married Lotte Wegener (1920–1989), the daughter of Alfred Wegener, German polar researcher and originator of the theory of continental drift. Her father had died on a Greenland expedition when she was 10. Their son Peter Harrer was born in December 1939, three months after Harrer had been interned by British forces in India. Their marriage was dissolved in 1943 while he was still in India. In 1953, he married Margaretha Truxa (divorce in 1958), and in 1962 he married Katharina (Carina) Haarhaus (1922–2014), who remained his wife until his death.
Final years
In the early 1980s, he visited Tibet again, and wrote a sequel to Seven Years in Tibet, titled Return to Tibet: Tibet After the Chinese Occupation. The Kirkus Review of his sequel said: In 1982 he was abl

Donald Featherstone (January 25, 1936 – June 22, 2015) was an American artist most widely known for his 1957 creation of the plastic pink flamingo while working for Union Products.[2] Featherstone resided in Fitchburg, Massachusetts,[3] where he kept 57 plastic flamingos on his back lawn.[4] Featherstone and his wife Nancy dressed alike for over 35 years.[3]
Biography
Featherstone was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1936[5] and grew up in nearby Berlin. After graduating from the Worcester Art Museum's art school, in 1957, he was offered a job designing three-dimensional animals for Union Products, Inc.[3] Over his years at Union Products, Featherstone sculpted over 750 different items, the first two of which were a girl with a water can and a boy with a dog.[3] When Featherstone was asked in 1957 to sculpt a duck, he purchased one, which he named Charlie, and later released the bird in Coggshall Park.[3]  Later that year, he was asked to carve a flamingo. The now iconic pink flamingo went on sale in 1958,[3] when the color pink was popular.[6]
In 1996, Featherstone was awarded the 1996 Ig Nobel Art Prize for his creation of the pink flamingo,[1] and he also began his tenure as president of Union Products, which he held until he retired in 2000.[4]
On June 22, 2015, Featherstone died from Lewy body dementia at the age of 79.[7][8] Visitors often leave pink flamingos of their own on the lawn around his grave.[9]
Pink flamingo
Featherstone based his creation on photographs of flamingos from National Geographic,[6] as he was not able to obtain real flamingos to use as models. As time went on, the plastic flamingo became more popular. They appeared across the country and even as parts of various art exhibits. In 1987, Donald Featherstone inscribed his signature in the original plastic mold.[10] This was apparently to help distinguish between original and "knock-off" pink plastic flamingos.[10] Featherstone's signature stayed on the bird until 2001, when it was removed.[4] The signature was quickly replaced because of a small boycott of the unsigned birds.[4]
In November 2006, Union Products closed and production of the flamingo stopped.[10] Shortly thereafter, a New York company purchased the molds for Featherstone's flamingos and subcontracted production to a Fitchburg company, Cado Products.[11] In 2010, Cado Products purchased the copyrights and plastic molds for the pink flamingos and continues to manufacture them.  They are generally sold in sets of two—one holding its head erect, nearly three feet (0.91 m) high, the other bending over as if looking for food.[6]

In his 2010 debut season he ranked seventh, and was named Rookie of the Year. In 2011 he won his first Champions Tour event at Long Island, New York, receiving surfing's largest-ever prize of $300,000.[7]
During the 2015 tour, Wright won his second title at the Fiji Pro event scoring two perfect 10-point rides.[5] This was the first time such a score had been achieved at the one event and he was only the fifth surfer to ever achieve a perfect 20. The win took him to third place in the 2015 season's standings.[7][13]
In December, in the lead up to the Pipeline Masters, the final event of the 2015 calendar, he had a wipe out at Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.[12][14] Wright suffered a traumatic brain injury and had to relearn how to talk, walk and then surf again.[12] He recorded his recovery steps on social media.[15] Owen is now championing the use of safety helmets while surfing to protect surfers from wipeout injuries.
After spending 2016 recovering, Wright was granted a wildcard entry to the 2017 World Surf League season.
In his comeback, Wright won the Champions Tour calendar's opening event, the Quiksilver Pro  at Snapper Rocks on Australia's Gold Coast.[14] It was his third WSL title.[16]
In between WSL events, Wright trained with Surfing Australia's national squad preparing for the debut of surfing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games[17] where he won a bronze medal.
In August 2023, Wright released his debut memoir, Against The Water, which tells the story of "his relationship with the ocean, his children, and his brain".[18] The book is published by Simon & Schuster.

Mike TrivisonnoBorn(1947-09-20)September 20, 1947East Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.DiedOctober 28, 2021(2021-10-28) (aged 74)OccupationRadio Broadcaster
Mike Trivisonno (September 20, 1947 – October 28, 2021) was an American radio broadcaster, known for hosting his own self-titled afternoon talk show on Cleveland radio station WTAM AM 1100.[1] He was widely referred to simply as "Triv" by callers and the Cleveland media.
Career
He was a frequent caller on the Sportsline radio show on WTAM AM 1100 (during this period the station was operating under the WWWE call letters). The show was hosted by the acerbic Pete Franklin and dealt with Cleveland sports. Franklin, who would typically cut off most callers, began giving "Mike from Mayfield" some latitude due to knowledgeable commentary, particularly regarding the Cleveland Browns. Franklin began mockingly referring to Trivisonno as "Mr. Know It All," a moniker he would carry into his own radio career.[2]
Trivisonno eventually began his own broadcasting career in 1987, working for a time at WNCX, commenting on sports (particularly boxing) and becoming a full-time personality from 1989–1992.[3]
He began hosting Sportsline on WWWE in 1994. At first, the show aired from 6-11 p.m. The show did well in the ratings, even though it was usually up against Cleveland Indians games on WKNR. It did so well, the decision was made to put Trivisonno in afternoon drive-time (under the Sportsline banner until 1998; under his own name since) ultimately leaving Sportsline to other hosts. Throughout the program's history, The Mike Trivisonno Show was usually either first or second in ratings in its time slot in the market.[4]
His show had been originally dedicated mostly to sports, but over time became a forum for discussing sports, politics, local issues, current events, or whatever else was on Trivisonno's mind at the time.[5] He discussed topics (and frequently argued) with listeners who called in to the show and/or with his various producers and sidekicks that worked alongside him.[6]
Trivisonno's popularity and high ratings led him to be ranked numerous times among Talkers Magazine's "Heavy Hundred", including most recently in 2015, when he came in at #72.[7] He was also a nominee for the Large Market Personality of the Year Marconi Award in 2010.[4]
Personal life
Trivisonno was born in East Cleveland, Ohio, and attended Mayfield High School in Cleveland's eastern suburbs. He was married to his high school sweetheart Linda Conforto, who died of lung and brain cancer in 2009, at age 61. The couple have three children, two sons and a daughter, and two grandchildren.[8]
On April 1, 2011, Trivisonno married his girlfriend, Tami in Las Vegas. His brother, Gary, a golfer, was also a radio personality on WTAM, hosting a weekly golf show.[9] His son, Michael Jr., owns an upscale restaurant called Trivs in suburban Strongsville, Ohio.[10]
He died unexpectedly on October 28, 2021, at the age of 74. The cause of death is unknown.[11]

Daniel Dubois (born 6 September 1997) is a British professional boxer who held the World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight title (Regular version) from 2022 to 2023. At regional level, he has held multiple heavyweight championships, including the British and Commonwealth titles from 2019 to 2020. As an amateur, he was a five-time national junior titlist and British champion. He currently holds a 95% knockout-to-win percentage.[3]
Amateur career
His father took him to the boxing gym at the age of nine to stay out of trouble in South London.[4] He trains at the Peacock Gym in Canning Town, working under Tony and Martin Bowers.[5][6] Dubois had around 75 amateur bouts. He won two English schoolboy titles, two junior ABAs plus the CYPs. Won the British Seniors. He spent a year and a half as part of the GB Elite set-up in Sheffield and boxed for England around a dozen times, competing at the European Youth championships twice and winning gold medals at multi-nations in Tammer (Finland) and Brandenburg (Germany).[4] He left the amateurs early with only a handful of senior amateur bouts. He was on the Great Britain Olympic team with the plan to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, however he opted to turn professional instead,[4] signing with boxing promoter Frank Warren of Queensberry Promotions.[5]
Professional career
Early career
Dubois' first fight as a professional was a knockout win in the first 35 seconds of the first round against Marcus Kelly in April 2017.[7] In his fourth fight, he knocked out Mauricio Barragan, a late substitute, in the second round to win the vacant WBC Youth heavyweight title.[8][9] In October 2017, he knocked out AJ Carter in the first round to claim the Southern Area heavyweight title.[10][11] He won the English heavyweight title in his eighth fight in June 2018, beating journeyman Tom Little by stoppage in the fifth round.[12] He won the WBO European title in March 2019, beating former WBO heavyweight title challenger, Răzvan Cojanu, in two rounds.[13] Dubois was taken the full distance for the first time by veteran Kevin Johnson in October 2018, winning on points after ten rounds,[14] and beat Richard Lartey in the fourth round in April 2019.[15][16]
In July 2019, he beat Nathan Gorman by knockout in the fifth round to improve his record to 12 wins, 11 by stoppage, and win the vacant British heavyweight title.[6][17] Boxing journalist Steve Bunce said he “...fought like an old, seasoned bruiser, his feet flawless, his jab a stiff weapon inherited from relics of the ring".[6] BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello described him as "...one of the brightest prospects in the sport at the moment."[17]
In his next fight, Dubois faced Ebenezer Tetteh. Dubois blasted Tetteh out in the first round, while dropping him twice in the process.[18]
After that, Dubois faced Japanese heavyweight Kyotaro Fujimoto. Fujimoto was overmatched from the beginning, fighting to survive from the opening bell. In the second round, Dubois connected on a right hand that knocked out Fujimoto.[19]
On 29 August 2020, Dubois had another dominant win, this time against Ricardo Snijders. Dubois managed to drop his opponent three times in the first round. The first round would end up being the last that Snijders would survive, as the referee waved the fight off after Dubois dropped his opponent for the fourth time.[20]
Rise up the ranks
On 28 November 2020, Dubois made the first defence of his British and Commonwealth titles, alongside his WBC Silver and WBO International titles, in a highly anticipated domestic matchup against Joe Joyce at the Church House in London, with the vacant European title also on the line. In a closely contested fight that had implications for future world title hopes, Dubois was landing the harder and cleaner punches while Joyce stayed at range behind powerful jabs. The repeated accurate jabs from Joyce caused swelling to the left eye of Dubois from the second round. In the tenth, after another hard jab landed on his now-swollen-shut eye, Dubois went down on one knee, allowing the referee to count him out to suffer the first loss of his career.[21] Following the fight it was revealed that Dubois had suffered a broken left orbital bone and nerve damage around the eye.[22]
After a layoff of over six months, Dubois returned to the ring on 5 June 2021 to face Bogdan Dinu in Telford. Dubois won the bout by second-round knockout, winning the vacant WBA interim heavyweight title in the process. The win also made him the mandatory challenger for the WBA (Regular) title held by undefeated Trevor Bryan.[23]
Dubois made his US debut on the undercard of Jake Paul vs. Tyron Woodley on 29 August 2021. He faced Joe Cusumano, and prevailed via first-round technical knockout victory. In his post-fight interview, he expressed interest in challenging Trevor Bryan for his WBA (Regular) title.[24]

On 11 June 2022, Dubois defeated Trevor Bryan by knockout in the fourth round to become the WBA (Regular) heavyweight champion in front of approximately 500 spectators at Casino Miami in Florida on a card promoted by Don King.[25][26]
Dubois made the first defence of his WBA (Regular) heavyweight title against Kevin Lerena on 3 December 2022, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, in London, England on the undercard of Tyson Fury vs Derek Chisora III.[27] Although he was knocked down in the first round 3 times, he prevailed and won by 3rd round technical knockout.[28]
On 26 August 2023, Dubois challenged unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk in Wrocław, Poland for Usyk's WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO and The Ring titles.[29] While Usyk retained his titles via ninth-round stoppage, there was controversy surrounding the events of the fifth round, when Usyk dropped to the canvas following a punch from Dubois that was controversially ruled a low blow by referee Luis Pabon. Accordingly, Usyk was given a maximum of five minutes to recover, but despite declaring he was ready to continue, Pabon urged Usyk to take more time out. Usyk ultimately used three minutes and forty-five seconds before the fight resumed. Usyk forced Dubois to take a knee in the eighth round and again in the ninth round, where he was counted out.[30][31] According to CompuBox stats, Usyk had outlanded Dubois in every round of the fight, landing 88 of 359 punches thrown (24.5%) to Dubois' 47 of 290 (16.2%). Dubois failed to land double digits in any round of the fight.[32]
Debate subsequently followed regarding the fifth round low blow as many observers felt it should actually have been ruled a legal punch and thus potentially resulted in a KO victory for Dubois. In his post-fight interview, Dubois opined: "I didn’t think that was a low blow. I thought that landed, and I’ve been cheated out of victory tonight.” However, Usyk's promoter Alex Krassyuk argued "The belly button is the line. Anything low of that is a low blow." This argument was echoed by others including boxers Tony Bellew and Liam Smith.[33][34][35]
Return to the ring
Dubois vs. Miller
Dubois fought Jarrell Miller on December 23, 2023, on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs Otto Wallin at the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, stopping him in the tenth round with only 10 seconds left.[36]
Personal life
Dubois' father is from Grenada.[37] His younger sister Caroline Dubois is also a boxer. She has represented Great Britain and in 2018 became the -60 kg European Junior, World Youth and Youth Olympic champion.[38]

Tiffany Cornilia Haddish[1] (born December 3, 1979)[2] is an American stand-up comedian and actress.[3] Her breakthrough came in with a leading role in the comedy film Girls Trip (2017), which earned her several accolades and was included on The New Yorker's list of the best film performances of the 21st century.[4] She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2018,[5] and The Hollywood Reporter listed her among the 100 most powerful people in entertainment in both 2018 and 2019.[6]
After guest-starring on several television series and a lead role on a cable drama, Haddish gained prominence for her roles in the NBC sitcom The Carmichael Show (2015–2017), the TBS series The Last O.G. (2018–2020), and the Apple TV+ comedy series The Afterparty (2022–2023), portraying Detective Danner. She also executive produced and voiced Tuca in the Netflix/Adult Swim animated series Tuca & Bertie (2019–2022). Haddish also starred in films such as Keanu (2016), Night School (2018), Nobody's Fool (2018), The Kitchen (2019), Like a Boss (2020), and Here Today (2021).
She won a Primetime Emmy Award for hosting a Saturday Night Live episode (2017) and published a memoir, The Last Black Unicorn (2017).
She also released the album Black Mitzvah in 2019, for which she won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, making her the second African-American woman to win this prize after Whoopi Goldberg in 1986.
Early life
Haddish was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, California.[7] Her father, Tsihaye Reda Haddish, was an Eritrean Jew.[8] Her mother, Leola, was an African-American small business owner, from a Christian family.[9][10][11][12] After Haddish's father left when she was three years old, her mother remarried and had Haddish's two half-sisters and two half-brothers.[13]
Tiffany's sister, Jasmine English, placed 7th in the TV show Claim to Fame, being voted out on August 15, 2022.[citation needed]
In 1988, while her family was living in Colton, California,[14] Haddish's mother Leola suffered severe brain damage in a car accident. It was believed to have caused Leola's schizophrenia; Haddish said her mother became quick-tempered, abusive and violent.[15] Haddish, then nine years old and the oldest of five siblings, became the family's primary caregiver.[15] It was around this time that Haddish became interested in humor. She said, "If I could make [Leola] laugh and turn her anger into some joy, I was less likely to get beat. Same thing in school: If I could make the kids laugh, they'd help me with my homework and protect me from other bullies."[16]
According to Haddish, her stepfather later told her he had tampered with the brakes on her mother's car, intending the wreck to kill Haddish, her siblings, and her mother so he could collect on their life insurance policies. However, the children chose to stay home that day, and the accident was not fatal for her mother.[17][15]
When Haddish was 13, she and her siblings were put into foster care and temporarily separated from one another. While there, she used comedy to cope with being with unfamiliar people.[18] When she was 15, she and her siblings were reunited under their grandmother's care. At one point early in life, she was hospitalized with toxic shock syndrome.[14]
She attended George Ellery Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles and graduated from El Camino Real High School, also in Woodland Hills, where she was the school mascot.[14] She said she could not read very well until high school, but improved when she received tutoring from a teacher.[12] She also got into a lot of trouble at school, despite her award-winning participation in drama competitions presenting Shakespearean monologues. In 2018, Haddish stated that she had been raped at age 17 by a police cadet, which she says led to her aggressiveness in avoiding unwanted advances from men.[19][20] After graduating from high school, Haddish was homeless, living in her car for a period of time.[21][22]
In 1997, after her social worker gave her an ultimatum to attend either psychiatric therapy or the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp, the 17-year-old Haddish opted for comedy as an outlet for her pain.[14][23] She says that the mentorship from many notable comedians—including Richard Pryor, Dane Cook, Charles Fleischer and the Wayans brothers—helped her discover a passion for comedy that "literally saved her life."[24][14] She incorporates her life experiences in her sets, finding that it functions as a "safe space" for her.[14]
Haddish was accepted to New York University, but the tuition and her aversion to debt kept her from attending. She later attended Santa Monica College.[25] Prior to her onscreen success, she held a number of jobs, including customer service for Air New Zealand at Los Angeles International Airport and Alaska Airlines.[26][27] She said she lived in her car during her twenties, in her early days of comedy.[24]
Career
2006–2017: Breakthrough with Girls Trip
Haddish's first break was a spot on the comedy competition Bill Bellamy's Who's Got Jokes?[28] She has appeared on such shows as Chelsea Lately, That's So Raven, My Name Is Earl, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Underground, Nick Cannon's Short Circuitz, @midnight, Just Jordan, In the Motherhood, Def Comedy Jam, Reality Bites Back and New Girl, and has starred in movies including Meet the Spartans and Janky Promoters.[29] In 2013, she had a recurring role on Real Husbands of Hollywood. In 2014, she was cast in the Oprah Winfrey Network drama series If Loving You Is Wrong.[30] She left after the first season for a regular role on the NBC sitcom The Carmichael Show, where she starred as Nekeisha, the semi-estranged wife of Bobby Carmichael (Lil Rel Howery) for three seasons.[28] In 2016, she co-starred opposite Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key in the comedy film Keanu in the role of Hi C.[31]
In 2017, Haddish starred alongside Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah in the comedy film Girls Trip.[9][32] It received widely positive reviews from critics, attaining an approval rating of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes[33] and a "generally favorable reviews" score of 71 out of 100 from Metacritic.[34] Haddish was acclaimed for her performance as the loud happy-go-lucky Dina, with several critics likening her breakthrough to that of Melissa McCarthy.[35][36] Katie Walsh of the Chicago Tribune proclaimed that "this is Haddish's movie, and will make her a star. It's clear from the moment she hits the screen..."[37] Further, Girls Trip grossed over $140 million worldwide against its production budget of $20 million to become the highest-grossing comedy film of 2017.[38]  In 2021, Haddish's performance was included on The New Yorker's list of the best film performances of the 21st century.[4] The author of the list, Richard Brody, wrote that "...where most comedians, even improvising, appear to create a persona, Haddish imbues her work with the force of her own experience. If the seventeen-minute speech that she gave at the New York Film Critics Circle banquet in 2018 had been released as a film, it would have made my list, too. Both it and her performance in Girls Trip, as great as they are, only hint at the power of her inventive imagination."[4]
In August 2017, Haddish's stand-up comedy special Tiffany Haddish: She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood premiered on Showtime.[39] Reviewing the special for Vox, Caroline Framke stated, "Haddish is just really damn funny, and deserves a recommendation wherever we can give it to her... [She] unleashes hilarious, filthy, and even moving anecdotes to tell the story of her life to this point, without anything holding her back, at long last."[40] Haddish also co-hosted the BET game show Face Value with Deon Cole. She hosted the November 11, 2017 episode of Saturday Night Live, making her the first African-American woman stand-up comedian to host the show;[41] it won her the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[42] Her memoir, The Last Black Unicorn (written with Tucker Max[43]) was released in December 2017 by Simon & Schuster[44] and debuted at #15 on The New York Times best-seller list.[45]
2018–present: Night School and other roles
Beginning in 2018, Haddish starred opposite Tracy Morgan in the TBS sitcom The Last O.G., her first lead in a sitcom.[46] Her 2018 film roles include a supporting part in Uncle Drew, and a lead role, opposite Kevin Hart, in the comedy Night School, reuniting with Girls Trip director Malcolm D. Lee.[47] In parallel, she starred in the Tyler Perry movie Nobody's Fool with Tika Sumpter, Omari Hardwick, Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley and Whoopi Goldberg. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $33 million worldwide.[48] In 2018, Haddish signed a first-look deal with HBO[49] and was named one of the 100 most influential people in world by Time magazine.[5] In the same year, The Hollywood Reporter listed her among the 100 most powerful people in entertainment, and again in 2019.[6]
In 2019, Haddish voiced Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part; Daisy in The Secret Life of Pets 2; and Tuca on the Netflix animated sitcom Tuca & Bertie,[50] which premiered in May.[51] Also that year, ABC revived Kids Say the Darndest Things with Haddish as host and producer.[52] It premiered on October 6 as part of a three-hour family-oriented block of programming.[53] In August 2019, Netflix premiered her new comedy special, Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready. In each episode, Haddish introduced one of her favorite stand-up comedians in order to give them mainstream exposure.[54] The series included stand-up sets from Chaunté Wayans, April Macie, Tracey Ashley, Aida Rodri

Larry Craig Morton (born February 5, 1943) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons, primarily with the Dallas Cowboys and Denver Broncos. He played college football for the California Golden Bears, receiving All-American honors, and was selected by the Cowboys fifth overall in the 1965 NFL Draft. Following nine seasons with the Cowboys, a quarterback controversy with Roger Staubach led to Morton joining the New York Giants for three seasons. He spent his final six seasons as a member of the Broncos, winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year and AFC Offensive Player of the Year in 1977.
Morton is the first starting quarterback to appear in the Super Bowl with more than one franchise, having helped lead the Cowboys to Super Bowl V and the Broncos to Super Bowl XII. He is also the only quarterback to start for multiple franchises in their inaugural Super Bowl appearance. Morton was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992.
Early years
Morton is a 1961 graduate of Campbell High School in Campbell, California, where he received All-state honors in football baseball and basketball. In football, he received  honors as a senior.
As a pitcher, Morton received offers from major league teams to play in their minor league systems. Morton was voted Northern California high school athlete of the year as a quarterback and was selected to play in the annual California Shrine High School football game.
College career
Morton played college football at the University of California, Berkeley, under head coach Marv Levy and assistant coach Bill Walsh, both future NFL head coaches and members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Morton became the starter in the sixth game of his sophomore season in 1962. Back then his nickname was "Big Hummer" and his production dominated the Golden Bears offense output.
As a sophomore in 1962, he only played in the last five games because of a knee injury he suffered in practice while returning punts. He still managed 905 passing yards, a 54% completion rate and 9 touchdowns. As a junior in 1963 he already owned most of Cal's all-time quarterback records.
In his three seasons as a starter at Cal, he never played on a winning team. He completed 185 of 308 passes for 2,121 yards and 13 touchdowns in his senior season in 1964, but even with a losing 3–7 record, he was recognized for his talent and contributions by being named first-team All-American over other winning quarterbacks. He also received the W. J. Voit Memorial Trophy, given to the best player on the Pacific Coast and the Pop Warner Trophy, given to the best senior player. In the balloting for the Heisman Trophy won by John Huarte of Notre Dame, Morton was seventh, ahead of Joe Namath of Alabama and Gale Sayers of Kansas.[2][3]
Morton finished his college career with 4,501 passing yards (a Pac-8 record), and most of Cal's All-time passing records, including:
In 1964 as the starting quarterback for the West, he faced Roger Staubach in the East–West Shrine Game, which was a sign of things to come.
He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the Cal Athletic Hall of Fame and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame.
Professional career
Dallas Cowboys
Morton was selected by the  Dallas Cowboys fifth overall in the 1965 NFL Draft. He spent his first four seasons as the backup for Don Meredith, but still received opportunities to play due to periodic injuries suffered by Meredith.
In 1969, he became the starter at quarterback over Roger Staubach, after Meredith's unexpected retirement. Morton dislocated a right finger in preseason and had to miss the season opener. In the next three games, he had a 71.1% passing percentage and was seen as having a promising future as the starter. In the fourth game against the Atlanta Falcons, he suffered a separated right shoulder after being tackled by Tommy Nobis. In the next contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, he set club records with 10 consecutive passes and 5 touchdown passes in a single game, although he sat most of the second half. He did not miss any games because of his shoulder, but his effectiveness decreased to 53.6% the rest of the season, as he caused more damage.[4] He had surgery on his right shoulder during the offseason.[5]
In 1970, although he was bothered most of the season recuperating from his right shoulder surgery, he finished third in the NFL in passer rating with 89.8. He also led the Cowboys to Super Bowl V, where the team lost 16–13 to the Baltimore Colts. He had surgery on his right elbow during the offseason.
In 1971, head coach Tom Landry created one of the most famous quarterback controversies in NFL history,[6] when he began alternating Morton with Staubach as the starting quarterback, reaching its extreme against the Chicago Bears, where they alternated between plays. After this famous game, Landry settled on Staubach and the Cowboys went on a 10-game winning streak that included a 24–3 victory in Super Bowl VI over the Miami Dolphins.
In 1972, Staubach suffered a separated right shoulder in the third preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams and Morton was named the starter. Although Staubach was activated in the fifth game of the season, by then Morton was entrenched at quarterback. For the first time since 1969, his arm had regained its strength, helping him register 185 completions (club record) out of 339 attempts (54.6%), 2,396 yards (fifth in the league), 15 touchdowns and 21 interceptions.[7] He was replaced late in the third quarter of the first-round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. Staubach entered an apparently hopeless situation trailing 28–13 and threw two touchdown passes in the last 90 seconds to win the game 30–28,[8] eventually sealing Morton's fate with the team.
On March 18, 1974, he was selected by the Birmingham Americans in the second round (18th overall) of the WFL Pro Draft. On April 10, after repeatedly asking for a trade, Morton signed a contract with the Houston Texans of the World Football League for their 1975 season. He never played a down with them; he was traded to the New York Giants six games into the 1974 season,[9] in exchange for their number-one draft choice in 1975 (#2-Randy White) and a second-round draft choice in 1976 (#40-Jim Jensen).[10]
New York Giants
After acquiring Morton, the Giants traded their starting quarterback Norm Snead to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a third-round draft choice in 1975 and a fourth in 1976.[11] During his time with the Giants, he struggled along with the team, and "felt the vocal wrath of the fans."[12] He was traded to the Denver Broncos in 1977 in exchange for quarterback Steve Ramsey and a fifth-round draft choice in 1978 (#137-Brian DeRoo). In his 34 career games with the Giants over three seasons, he had an 8–25–0 record, throwing for a total of 5,734 yards, 29 touchdowns, 49 interceptions and a 52.1 completion percentage.
Denver Broncos
At age 34, Morton revived his career with the Broncos,[13] finishing the season as the second-rated passer in the AFC. Morton was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year for 1977 and selected All-AFC by the Sporting News. Although he suffered in the playoffs from a swollen left hip that needed to be drained,[14] he overcame the injury to become the first NFL quarterback to start the Super Bowl for two different teams (Dallas in V and Denver in XII), a feat only equaled by Kurt Warner, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady.[15] Morton is also the only quarterback to have started for two different teams' inaugural Super Bowl appearances. Unlike Warner, Manning, and Brady, however, Morton would not win a Super Bowl as a starter. He threw a franchise playoff record four interceptions in Denver's defeat against his former team, the Cowboys, which led to him being pulled in favor of Norris Weese.
Morton's best statistical season came in his penultimate 17th season in 1981, when he threw for 3,195 yards and 21 touchdowns and had a 90.5 passer rating. He was a downfield passer not known for his mobility, but is one of the all-time leaders in yards per completion. He briefly held the record for the most consecutive passes completed. His 8.5 yards per attempt that season remains a Broncos franchise record, as do his 54 sacks, and two games where he was sacked seven times each (later matched by Elway and Tim Tebow).
Morton wore number 7 for the Broncos and retired just before the arrival of celebrated rookie John Elway in 1983,[16] who wore the same number and in whose honor it was retired. Morton remains the third all-time passing yards leader in franchise history with 11,895 and his regular-season record was 50 wins and 28 losses in five seasons. 
In 1986, Morton was inducted to the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Denver Broncos' Ring of Fame in 1988.

Coaching career and later life
Following his playing career, Morton served as head coach for the Denver Gold of the United States Football League (USFL). He was a voter in the Harris Interactive College Football Poll, a component of college football's now-defunct Bowl Championship Series.
In 2008, he co-authored a book with Denver Post writer Adrian Dater entitled "Then Morton Said to Elway..." - The Best Denver Broncos Stories Ever Told. The book was published by Triumph Books.

Kang Daniel (Korean: 강다니엘; commonly stylized as KANGDANIEL; born Kang Eui-geon [강의건]; December 10, 1996) is a South Korean singer-songwriter, actor, television host, and businessman who rose to fame in early 2017 as the first-place winner of the second season of reality competition series Produce 101. He is a former member of the show's resulting boy group Wanna One that, at the time, was a major power player in the K-pop industry.[5]
Following the end of Wanna One's activities as a group, Kang took a six-month hiatus from the entertainment industry and took over management of his career. In mid-2019, he released his solo debut extended play (EP), Color on Me, which was a commercial success that topped South Korea's Gaon Album Chart. His subsequent works from his color series titled Cyan (2020) and Magenta (2020) also topped the Gaon Album Chart with the former's title track earning Kang his first domestic top ten single. Further solidifying his career as a solo artist, Kang earned his first top five single in Korea as well as his first solo appearance on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart through the single "Paranoia".

He has made the Gallup Korea list of Most Preferred Idols in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list in 2019 and 2022, and appeared on People's list of talented emerging artists making their mark in 2022. In the same year, Kang was the recipient of the Seoul Mayor's Award for Culture due to his great contribution to the rise of Seoul's awareness by promoting the Korean Wave in various fields.[6]
Life and career
Early life and career beginnings
Kang Daniel was born as Kang Eui-geon (강의건) in Busan, South Korea as the only child of his family.[7] After spending his childhood and most of his teen years with his birth name, he decided to legally change it to Daniel due to family and friends having difficulty pronouncing Eui-geon.[8] On an episode of MBC's Radio Star, Kang cited a biblical figure as his source of inspiration for the name Daniel.[9] He began dancing in eighth grade through a b-boy club he joined following a teacher's suggestion and later attended a dance academy in Busan called Nataraja Academy.[10][11] Following this, Kang participated in a youth dance competition titled "Busan City Kids" where he and his teammate won against competitors such as Jimin (who would later become a member of BTS) and Park Woo-jin (who would later become a fellow member of Wanna One).[12][13] During a guest appearance at variety show Hello Counselor, Kang revealed that he was ostracized in elementary school because of his appearance and developed passion and built self-esteem through dancing.[14] To further pursue this passion, he attended Peniel Arts High School where he studied modern dance for a year with a focus on ballet and won a gold medal in the dance category at the 49th High School Performing Arts Contest.[15][16] Having been raised in a single parent household, Kang revealed that the "tuition [at his arts high school] was really expensive" for his mother who, at the time, was not feeling healthy.[17] This led to him dropping out of high school shortly after enrolling and later receiving the Korean equivalent of a General Educational Development (GED) credential.[18]
Prior to appearing on Produce 101 Season 2, Kang had trained for two years and one month.[19] He initially started as a trainee under B2M Entertainment until the company's acquisition and then became a trainee under MMO Entertainment. Throughout this training period, Kang did not receive dance or singing lessons due to both company's financial instability.[20] One of the most notable moments during his time as a trainee was his appearance on Her Secret Weapon, performing "Invitation" by Uhm Jung-hwa, where he served as a backup dancer to Fiestar's Cao Lu and Spica's Sihyun.[21]

Kang officially debuted as a solo artist on July 25 with the debut EP, Color on Me.[44] As reflected on Hanteo Chart, the EP set records for both the highest first-day and first-week physical sales for a solo artist since the chart's inception at the time.[45][46] Its lead single "What Are You Up To" gave Kang his first-ever solo music show win on KBS2's Music Bank on August 9.[47] He kicked off promotions for the EP with six different fan-sign events held across Korea between July 31 and August 3.[48] Following this, Kang embarked on the first fan meet tour of his solo career, touring six different cities: Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, and Manila, before ending in Seoul on November 24.[49] In the midst of touring, he also hosted his own radio show on NOW., Naver's online audio streaming service.[50] The Kang Daniel Show aired on Chuseok holiday with a total of four episodes released each day from September 11 to 14; with Gray making a guest appearance on the third episode.[51] In the same month, it was announced that Kang's contract with LM was officially terminated as both sides came to a mutual agreement.[4] Serving as his first comeback, Kang released two digital singles on November 25 called "Touchin'" and "Adulthood".[52][53] Unlike his solo debut, Kang was able to promote "Touchin'" by performing the song on several Korean music shows and won a trophy on SBS MTV's The Show on December 3.[54] However, after a week of promoting, Konnect announced that Kang would take a break to focus on his health.[55]

Malcolm Hedding (born 1952) is a South African anti-apartheid activist, theologian, evangelical minister, and Executive Director of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem (ICEJ).
Biography
Hedding was born in 1952 into a British descent family that had settled in the Eastern Cape region. His father, Guy Usher Hedding, managed a gold mine.[1]
Hedding entered the ministry in the early 1970s as a member of the Assemblies of God of Southern Africa. As a young ordained minister with the South African Assemblies of God, Hedding confronted the apartheid system from the pulpit and was forced to flee his homeland.[1]
Between 1986 and 1989, Malcolm a pastor of the Jerusalem Christian Assembly. During this period, he also functioned as the Chaplain for the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem.
As a Christian Zionist, Malcolm served from 1991 - 2000 as Chairman of "Christian Action for Israel," a biblical Zionist organization in South Africa.[2]
Malcolm Hedding has been involved with the work of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem (ICEJ) since 1981 and has been executive director since 2000.[3] On 27 May 2011, it was announced that he would be stepping down as executive director as of 31 July 2011.[4]
Views on Israel
Malcolm is currently a Christian Zionist leader based in Jerusalem who is challenging the branding of Israel with the "apartheid" label.[1] Hedding believes the Israeli barrier fence has "nothing to do with apartheid and everything to do with Israel's self-defense". He said that Israel has proven its desire to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians while granting political rights to its own Arab citizens within a liberal democratic system, but that the Palestinians remain committed to Israel's destruction. By contrast, he says, it was a tiny minority in South Africa that held power and once democracy came, the Nationalist Party that had dominated the masses disappeared.[1]
According to Hedding, "Evangelical support for Israel is founded not on a prophecy, but on a promise, [...] It is the promise God made to Abraham that the Jewish people would receive the land of Canaan for the sake of world redemption. The Jewish people became servants of the lord, to bring an understanding of revelation of God and his redemptive purpose to the world. Evangelicals defend their right to live in peace and security in land of Canaan, support that comes out of a sense of gratitude for what we've received."[5]
Hedding believes Israel proven its desire to reach a settlement with the Palestinians, while granting political rights to its Arab citizens within a democratic system. Nevertheless, he says that the Palestinians remain committed to Israel's destruction.[1]

Takeo Miki (三木 武夫, Miki Takeo, 17 March 1907 – 14 November 1988) was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1974 until 1976.
Early life and family
Takeo Miki's birthplaceTakeo Miki was born on 17 March 1907, in Gosho, Tokushima Prefecture (present-day Awa, Tokushima), the only child of farmer-merchant Hisayoshi Miki and his wife Takano. Aside from farming, his father traded fertilizers, sake, rice and general goods, though he was not a wealthy farmer (gōnō) or from a family of pedigree (kyūke). Hisayoshi was born in Kakihara, near Gosho, to farmer Rokusaburō Ino'o, and after briefly working in Osaka, he returned and began working for the Shibata family, the largest landowner in Gosho. He met Takano Miki, the daughter of farmer Tokitarō Miki, when the two were working for the Shibata family. Hisayoshi took Takano's surname after marriage, and the newlywed were given a house by the Shibata family.[1]
When Miki was born, Hisayoshi was 33 and Takano was 38 years old, and Miki was raised with much love as he was the only child. His mother was particularly careful about his healthcare.[1]
While studying at Meiji University's Faculty of Law, Miki was able to visit the United States, where he saw firsthand both Anglo-American liberal society as well as that society's aversion towards totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and the Soviet Union. He attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from the institution in 1966.[2]
Pre-LDP political career
Takeo Miki on 10 March 1952 on Mainichi ShimbunDuring 1937, Miki was elected to the Diet; he remained there for the rest of his life, winning re-election no fewer than 19 times over 51 years. In the 1942 general election he openly voiced opposition to the military government under Hideki Tojo and still managed to win a seat; his efforts at this time were assisted by Kan Abe, the grandfather of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.[3]
In the earlier post-war period, Miki led the centrist National Cooperative Party in the 1947 and 1949 general elections, to limited success. In the early 1950s, Miki joined Ichirō Hatoyama's Democratic Party,[4] which was one of the two main conservative factions of the time and took a stance that was critical of Shigeru Yoshida and his Liberal Party. These two factions eventually merged in 1955 to form the modern-day Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which Miki joined as well.
Later political career (in the LDP)
As the head of an LDP faction, Miki held cabinet posts in the administrations of Ichirō Hatoyama, Nobusuke Kishi, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku Satō. However, he was especially critical of the Kishi administration, and was strongly opposed to Kishi's handling of the massive 1960 Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.[5] When Kishi railroaded the treaty through the Diet on May 19, 1960, Miki's faction absented itself from the vote in protest of Kishi's heavy-handed approach.[5] On May 28, Miki and fellow faction leader Kenzō Matsumura issued a public call for Kishi's resignation,[5] and Kishi was ultimately forced to resign in July.[6]  However, when Ichirō Kōno floated a plan later that summer to split up the LDP, Miki and Matsumura ultimately declined to support him.[7] As punishment for taking part in the anti-Kishi rebellion, Miki was initially excluded from the cabinet of Kishi's successor Hayato Ikeda. However by the following year, Ikeda had cemented his power enough to overcome the objections of the Kishi faction and bring Miki back into the cabinet as Head of the Science and Technology Agency.[8]
Although Ikeda was re-elected as party president in 1964, he retired soon afterwards due to illness. In the debate over who would succeed Ikeda as prime minister, Miki supported Kishi's brother Eisaku Satō while Matsumura supported Ichirō Kōno. This led to a falling out between Miki and his erstwhile ally Matsumura, and thereafter the two men went their separate ways. Miki's support for Satō also healed the rift that had been created when he had opposed Kishi during the Anpo crisis, and Miki was rewarded for his support with powerful posts in the Satō cabinet, first as Minister of International Trade and Industry (1965–66) and then as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1966–68).
As the foreign minister under Satō, Miki secretly met in 1967 with American ambassador to Japan U. Alexis Johnson to discuss "how to reconcile Japanese desire for reversion [of Okinawa] with [American] military requirements." This was part of a series of resolute attempts by several Japanese officials within the same time period aimed at convincing the United States to reconsider its continued hold on Okinawa, which the U.S. had formerly insisted should remain under American protection so long as there was any remaining instability in East Asia.[9] In matters of regional foreign policy, Miki was an early advocate of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and, in 1968, he said that "'it would be an act of suicide on our part to create an exclusive and closed trading bloc in the Pacific area."[10] Despite this, ASEAN would later decline to invite now-Prime Minister Miki to the organisation's very first summit at Bali in 1976, as economic perceptions towards Japan in the region were negative because of resentment towards both wartime abuse by Imperial Japan as well as Japan's current status as a powerful economic giant with a heavy trade surplus.[11]
Miki took over from Kakuei Tanaka as Prime Minister on 9 December 1974, following the latter's implication in the corruption concerning real-estate and construction companies. The attractiveness of Miki to the LDP bosses was chiefly due to his personal integrity, and his weak power base from his small faction. In fact, Miki had neither expected nor wanted to be prime minister at all, as was reflected when upon his election he murmured "a bolt from the blue".[citation needed]
While Miki was at the funeral of ex-PM Eisaku Sato in 1975, he was assaulted by a right-wing extremist named Hiroyoshi Fudeyasu, the secretary-general of the Greater Japan Patriotic Party[12] with foreign dignitaries nearby.[13] This caused criticism of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police over not doing enough to ensure his safety.[12]
In a 1976 Diet session, Miki reaffirmed a past order of Prime Minister Satō's cabinet dating back to 1967 in which the percent of the national GDP allocated towards defense spending was frozen so as to not exceed 1%.[14] This policy taboo was broken by future Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980s, but was revived in 1990 by another future Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, who was a member of the faction that descended from Miki's faction.[15][16] This policy has again come under renewed attention within modern Japan in light of contemporary discussions about constitutional revision and, by extension, the possible expansion of Japan's defense capabilities. In any event, Miki also pushed the Diet to fully ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,[17] and he also worked to further strengthen previous policies set in motion by Prime Minister Satō which virtually committed Japan to not engage in the export of arms to any country.[18]
After being elected, Miki attempted to reform the LDP, relentlessly investigating the Lockheed bribery scandals and refusing to halt the criminal prosecutions being made against his predecessor.[19] Miki also pursued political finance reforms.[20] These activities made him a large number of enemies within the party, and a campaign literally called "Down with Miki" ("Miki oroshi") was started by influential faction leaders. Despite Miki's personal popularity with the public, the Lockheed scandal reflected poorly on the party, which lost its overall majority in the 1976 election to the Diet and had to make deals with minor parties to remain in power. As is customary for Japanese political officials following heavy party setbacks, Miki then resigned.[21] He was succeeded on 24 December 1976, by Takeo Fukuda.
Personal life
In 1940, Miki married Mutsuko Mori, daughter of the prominent Japanese businessman and politician, Nobuteru Mori, who had founded Showa Denko, a major chemical engineering firm. His brother-in-law, Kiyoshi Mori, was the head of the now defunct Management and Coordination Agency, which would later become the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. His other brother-in-law, Yoshihide Mori, served as the chief of the Environment Agency, the forerunner of the present-day Ministry of the Environment.
Legacy
In Mao Zedong's final days, he took a great interest in Miki's political condition, as Miki was suffering a coup d'état from amongst his own party. Mao had never shown any interest in Miki before, or even mentioned him.
Connection to Seattle
During his time in Seattle, Miki spent a period as a dishwasher at noted Japanese restaurant Maneki.[23]
To commemorate the ties of Japan to America, and Seattle in particular, Miki gave 1,000 cherry trees to Seattle to commemorate the United States Bicentennial in 1976. This gift gave birth to the Seattle Cherry Blossom Festival, still running annually.[24]
Slang Term
In Hong Kong, the name "Takeo Miki" (三木武夫) is sometimes used to describe actors or actresses with wooden or no emotional expressions during movies or TV dramas. Some[who?] have said that the origin for the slang term stems from Miki's wooden expression during his appearance in news reports.

The play portrayed the adventures of three friends who travel to the capital to watch the show of their biggest pop idols. Blanco took the stage with the cast to sing "I'm Yours" by Jason Mraz, a song and video she recorded with the Pietros band (who also attended), plus "Meu Jeito Seu Jeito" (My Way, Your Way) from the Rebeldes catalog.
Blanco recorded the song "Turnaround" for the film A Brasileira (The Brazilian). The film's producers were Uri Singer and Fabio Golombek, and starring actors included Fernanda Machado, Greg Tuculescu, Dean Cain, Mariel Hemingway, and Scott Rodgers.
Blanco returned to telenovelas in Pecado Mortal (Mortal Sin), which debuted on September 25, 2013. Blanco radically changed her look for the role due to the nature of the plot, the 1970s setting, and to better resemble the actor who played her character's mother.
Blanco directed a series pilot for a show called UO, featuring actors Miguel Romulo, Mariana Molina, Rael Barja, and Diego Montez.
In early 2014, Blanco was cast in Se Eu Fosse Você – O Musical (If I Were You – The Musical), a stage adaptation of the popular Brazilian film of the same name. Lua played Bia, the daughter of protagonists Helena (Claudia Netto) and Claudio (Nelson Freitas). It opened on March 21, in Rio de Janeiro, under the supervision of Daniel Filho, Flavio Marinho, direction and choreography by Alonso Barros, and musica

Musical artistJapanese nameKanji坂本 九Hiraganaさかもと きゅうTranscriptionsRomanizationSakamoto Kyū
Kyu Sakamoto (Japanese: 坂本 九, Hepburn: Sakamoto Kyū, born Hisashi Sakamoto (坂本 九, Sakamoto Hisashi) and raised as Hisashi Ōshima (大島 九, Ōshima Hisashi), 10 December 1941 – 12 August 1985) was a Japanese singer and actor.
He was best known outside Japan for his international hit song "Ue o Muite Arukō" (known as "Sukiyaki" in English-speaking markets), which was sung in Japanese and sold over 13 million copies. It reached number one in the United States Billboard Hot 100 in June 1963, making Sakamoto the first Asian recording artist to have a number one song on the chart. He was also the first Japanese artist to have a number one single on the Australian singles chart.[1]
Sakamoto died on 12 August 1985 in the crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123, along with 519 others on board the flight, making him a casualty of the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history.
Life and career
Early years: 1941–1949
Childhood in Kawasaki and Kasama
Sakamoto was born on 10 December 1941, in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, to Hiroshi Sakamoto, a cargo tender officer, and his second wife, Iku. He was the youngest of his father's nine children, which is why he was nicknamed Kyū-chan (九ちゃん, Kyū-chan), meaning "lil nine". Kyū is also an alternative reading of the kanji of his given name, Hisashi (九).
In the summer of 1944, during the air raids over the greater Tokyo area, Kyu's mother took her three children to live with their maternal grandparents in rural Kasama, Ibaraki Prefecture. They moved back to Kawasaki in 1949. Their father's company had been closed by the American occupation forces and he opened a restaurant.[2]
1956–1958
Teenage life
In 1956, Kyu's parents divorced. His mother was given custody over her three minor children including Kyu, and they adopted the mother's maiden name, Ōshima. His older half-siblings kept their father's surname, Sakamoto. Kyu started playing guitar in high school, but he soon began singing.
First recordings (1959–1960)
JVC and Toshiba Records
In May 1958, when Sakamoto was 16 years old, he joined the Japanese pop-band The Drifters that had been formed three years earlier. Sakamoto was unhappy about his position in the band as second vocalist, and this often led to fights with the other members. His big breakthrough as a band member came 26 August 1958, when he sang at the annual music festival Western Carnival at the Nichigeki Hall. After a quarrel that ended in a fight with two of the other members, Sakamoto left the band in November 1958.
For a short period of time, Sakamoto returned to his studies and focused on entering university. By December 1958, he joined his classmate's Hisahiko Iida's band called Danny Iida and Paradise King. He replaced Hiroshi Mizuhara as singer. Sakamoto's career began to rise to expectations, where he ended his studies and left school. In June 1959, the band got a record deal at the JVC record company. The Paradise King and Sakamoto released their song "Kanashiki Rokujissai" in August 1960, which became a great hit. In the time after they released a number of songs that became very popular. This led to Sakamoto obtaining a record deal at the Toshiba Records company and left the Paradise King aiming at a solo career.[3]
Solo career (1961–1985)
Debut album and international success (1961–1964)

Sakamoto's solo career was inaugurated with the love song "Ue o Muite Arukō" written by Rokusuke Ei and Hachidai Nakamura. The song was first heard on the NHK entertainment program Yume de Aimashō on 16 August 1961. It became a smash hit and was released on red vinyl on October 15. It remained the highest selling record until January 1962, three months after its release.
His international breakthrough came in 1963 during a visit to Japan by Louis Benjamin, an executive of British record company Pye Records. Hearing the song several times, Benjamin decided to bring it back to England. Due to concerns that the title would be too hard for English-speakers to pronounce or remember, the song was renamed "Sukiyaki", after the Japanese cooked beef dish familiar to the English.  The new title was intended to sound both catchy and distinctive in Japanese, but other than the language, it had no actual connection to the song.
Initially, Pye Records released an instrumental version of the song recorded by Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen. After that became a hit in England, His Master's Voice (HMV) released the original, which also sold well, reaching sixth place in HMV's most sold records. In 1963, Capitol Records released the song in the US with the alternate title, eventually selling over one million copies,[4] and remaining number one on the Billboard Hot 100 number one single for three weeks in June 1963.
After the international success of "Ue o Muite Arukō", Sakamoto went on a world tour that lasted from summer of 1963 to the beginning of 1964. Among the countries he visited were the United States (including Hawaii), Germany, and Sweden. During his time in the U.S., he was invited to appear in several television shows. On 13 August 1963, he landed at Los Angeles International Airport and that evening, was a guest of television program The Steve Allen Show.[5] Sakamoto was also expected to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, but his appearance was canceled owing to a scheduling conflict with the production of his upcoming movie, Kyu-chan Katana o Nuite.[6]
Sakamoto had only one other song reach the U.S. charts, "China Nights (Shina no Yoru)" (Capitol 5016), which peaked at number 58 in 1963. His only American album, Sukiyaki and Other Japanese Hits (Capitol 10349), peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart (now known as the Billboard 200) in 1963 and remained on the Pop Albums chart for 17 weeks.
He received his sole foreign Gold Record of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) by Capitol Records on 15 May 1964 in Hotel Okura, Tokyo.
Later appearances
During the 1964 Summer Olympics, he was featured on the Swedish TV-program Hylands hörna broadcast live from Tokyo.[7]
In 1968, Sakamoto and Hachidai Nakamura participated in the international singing contest Festival Internacional da Canção in Rio de Janeiro with the song "Sayonara, Sayonara" and finished in 7th place.[8]
Marriage and family
In 1971, Sakamoto married Japanese actress Yukiko Kashiwagi. The couple had two daughters, Hanako and Maiko [ja].
Death
On August 12, 1985, Sakamoto was aboard Japan Air Lines Flight 123 (departing from Tokyo), heading to Osaka for an event. The plane crashed into two ridges of Mount Takamagahara in Ueno, Gunma, a disaster that remains the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history with 520 people killed, including Sakamoto.[9] He was interred at Chōkoku-ji Temple in the central Minato-ku area in Tokyo.
Legacy
His most popular song, "Ue o Muite Arukō" ("I look up when I walk") remains the only Japanese song to reach number one on the Billboard pop charts in the United States, a position it maintained for three weeks in 1963. It was also the first-ever Japanese language song to enter the Australian charts, where it reached #2. In addition, it made the UK charts, though it only climbed to number 6 with no further chart entries.
"Ue o Muite Arukō" has been covered multiple times over the years, beginning with the instrumental by Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. "Ue o Muite Arukō" was also covered as an instrumental, by English pianist Johnny Pearson, during 1982. Well-known English-language cover versions include a 1981 cover by A Taste of Honey and a 1995 cover by 4 P.M., both of which made the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. In 1989, Selena's self-titled album contained a Spanish translation of the Taste of Honey cover which was released as a single in 1990. The English lyrics have also appeared in whole or in part in songs by performers including Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh (1985's "La Di Da Di"),[10] Salt-N-Pepa (1985's "The Show Stopper"), Snoop Dogg (1993's "Lodi Dodi", a "La Di Da Di" cover), Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (1995's Bless Da 40 Oz.), Raphael Saadiq (1995's "Ask of You", another to make the Hot 100), Mary J. Blige (1997's "Everything") and Will Smith (1999's "So Fresh", featuring Slick Rick).
An American version by Jewel Akens with different English lyrics was written for it. Titled "My First Lonely Night (Sukiyaki)" in 1966, the song reached number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100.
On 16 March 1999, Japan Post issued a stamp commemorating Sakamoto and "Ue o Muite Arukō".[11] The stamp is listed in the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue as Japan number 2666 with a face value of 50 yen.

She became the second actress to win both the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil and Best Actress – Telugu in the same year, for her performances in the 2012 films Neethaane En Ponvasantham and Eega, respectively. Over the next few years, she played the leading lady in top-grossing androcentric films such as Dookudu (2011), Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Kaththi (2014), Theri (2016), 24 (2016), Mersal (2017), and Rangasthalam (2018).

The last of these earned her a Filmfare OTT Award. In 2023, she had two critical and commercial failures in Shaakuntalam and Kushi.[4][5]
Samantha was born on 28 April 1987, her father Joseph Prabhu is Telugu and mother Ninette Prabhu is Malayali.[6] She was born and brought up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu,[7] as the youngest child of the family, with two elder brothers Jonath and David. She can speak both Tamil and Telugu fluently. [8][9] As a part of her education, Samantha was schooled at Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School and then completed a degree in commerce at Stella Maris College, Chennai.[8][10] Towards the end of her undergraduate degree, she became involved in modelling, notably working with Naidu Hall, through which she was first spotted by filmmaker Ravi Varman.[citation needed]
Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Vasudev Menon's Telugu film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), was highly anticipated prior to release, primarily due to the first time collaboration between Gautham Menon and composer A. R. Rahman.[11] The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the project in August 2009. The film was shot in India and the United States, and it was released on 26 February 2010.[12] Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a "crucial part in moulding her as an actress", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she had no dialogues in a scene.[13] In the film, Samantha played the lead character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon release of the film, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film itself garnering widespread critical acclaim.[14] Critics at Sify praised Samantha as a "scene-stealer" and her beauty as "alluring", adding, "she was the girl to watch out for."[14] Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that "Samantha's debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema" and noted that the "minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her", whilst labelling the film as a "classic". Her performance in Ye Maaya Chesave earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South and the Nandi Special Jury Award.[15][16][17] Samantha appeared in a cameo role in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress.[18] Both the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be major successes, propelling Samantha to stardom.[19] She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana Thamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed.[citation needed]
Samantha's next release was the romantic drama, Baana Kaathadi (2010), opposite Adharvaa. The film was actually the third Tamil project signed by the actress, but its release preceded the first two that she was contracted for due to delays in their completion.[20][21] Samantha portrayed a student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the first such role in Tamil cinema.[22] Her next release was Ravi Varman's Moscowin Kavery (2010), originally the first film she began work on. The shooting for the film began in August 2007, with Samantha, then briefly credited with the screen name Yasodha, joining the team later in the year.[23] In an interview held in 2008, Ravi Varman mentioned that he had decided that Samantha would be the lead actress for his film within three minutes after viewing one of her commercial assignments.[24] He went on to describe her as an actress with "intelligence" and "potential", whilst drawing comparisons with the noted actress, Revathi.[24] However, due to Ravi Varman's prior commitments as cinematographer in other projects, the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010.[25] The film earned negative reviews from critics, though Samantha's performance was credited as one of the sole highlights that the film offered.[26] In August 2008, while still completing her last three projects, Samantha also signed up to play the lead role of a modern girl in the Narain-starrer, Pookada Ravi, which was later shelved.[27][28] Samantha then went on to feature in Vamsi Paidipally's Telugu film Brindaavanam (2010) in which she played a supporting role alongside NTR Jr and Kajal Aggarwal. Her performance as Indu was well-received despite having a shorter screen time, and the film became her second successful venture in Telugu.[citation needed]
Samantha featured in the big-budget Telugu film, Dookudu (2012) alongside Mahesh Babu, which became one of the most successful Telugu films of all time.[29] The film received positive reviews, with a critic from The Times of India stating "Samantha looks beautiful and has done a great job, though her role as Prashanthi isn't too lengthy."[30] She received her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in the film. She also subsequently made guest appearances in two of Gautham Vasudev Menon's films, first in the psychological thriller film, Nadunisi Naaygal (2011) as a mental asylum inmate and then repeated her role from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa in the Hindi version of the film, Ekk Deewana Tha (2012). Her popularity in Telugu films led to Nadunisi Naaygal was dubbed and released in Telugu as Eera Gulabeelu, with Samantha featured prominently on the film's posters, despite only having a guest appearance.[31] During the period, Samantha had also been signed two big-budget projects in Tamil, Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) and Shankar's I (2015), but was forced to opt out from both films, since she was suffering from a skin disease and could not work for two months during mid-2012.[32][33][34] Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual project Eega (2012) alongside Nani and Sudeep, portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes revenge for the murder of her lover.[35] As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns, calling the process "very stressful" but "satisfying".[36] Titled Naan Ee (2012) in Tamil, the film opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won high critical acclaim for her performance. A critic from The Hindu noted "Samantha blooms in the role given to her," while Jeevi of Idlebrain.com wrote her "successful run continues as she portrays the role a bereaved lover with perfection".[37][38] Sify.com also praised her performance in the film, citing her "subtle expressions of love, fear and anxiety work well for the film" and that she "looks beautiful and has performed her role with consummate ease".[39][40] The film went on to become a major commercial success, grossing more than ₹ 1.25 billion, and went on to be dubbed in several foreign and Indian languages.[41][42][43]
Samantha then worked on Gautham Vasudev Menon's a trilingual romantic drama film and played the leading female role of Nithya in the Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi versions of the film, shooting scenes simultaneously back-to-back with three different actors. The Tamil version, Neethaane En Ponvasantham (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A further Hindi version titled Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with the other two films and was "60%" completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi film, Ekk Deewana Tha, had failed at the box office.[44] The film spanned three periods in the life of a couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she "could relate to the attributes and the circumstances the character goes through" and described Nithya's character as "close to her."[45] To make her performance as authentic as possible, Samantha chose to dub for herself in the Tamil version of the film. The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning polarizing reactions. Neethane En Ponvasantham earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box office, though Samantha received highly critical acclaim for her portrayal. The critic from The Hindu noted she "comes up with possibly the best performance by a female lead in Tamil cinema this year" and "her transformation from a gawky teenager to an adult, unable to overcome her ego, is outstanding".[46] Meanwhile, IBN stated "Samantha's transformation from a school kid to an adult is a treat to watch," while Rediff.com noted she is "pretty, graceful, and does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of a girl in love, especiall

Quintus Sosius Senecio (fl. 1st century AD) was a Roman senator who was favored by the emperors Domitian and Trajan. As a result of this relationship, he was twice ordinary consul, an unusual and prestigious honor: first in 99, with Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus as his colleague; and again in 107 as the colleague of Lucius Licinius Sura, who was himself consul for the third time.
Career
Senecio's origins are unknown. He has been identified as the subject of an inscription where the name of the subject is lost,[1] which provides us his cursus honorum.[2] The earliest office recorded on this inscription was quattuorviri viarum curandarum, one of the four boards that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in one of these was a required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. His next recorded office was as quaestor of the senatorial province of Achaea; upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate.[3] The inscription omits all mention of a term of service as military tribune; John D. Grainger speculates that Senecio may have served with Legio XXI Rapax, which was destroyed by the Iazyges in 92.[4] He was the emperor's candidate for plebeian tribune and praetor, a clear honor; that the emperor's name is not provided suggests he was Domitian, who suffered damnatio memoriae after his death. After achieving the rank of praetor, Senecio was commissioned legatus legionis or commander of Legio I Minervia. He was then appointed legatus pro praetore or governor of Gallia Belgica for the term 96 to 98.[5] It was while governor that Senecio provided early support to Trajan.[4]
Senecio became consul ordinarius in 99. During the Dacian Wars, he held the governorship of Moesia Inferior.[6] Afterwards he earned a second consulate in 107 as well as a statue at state expense.
Personal details
Senecio was a member of literary circles. Pliny the Younger addressed two letters to a "Senecio" who is commonly identified with him. The first, beginning with "This year has produced a healthy crop of poets", is on the health of contemporary Roman literature.[7] The second is a request for a commission as military tribune on behalf of a relative of Pliny's friend Gaius Calvisius Rufus.[8] Plutarch also dedicated several of his Parallel Lives (Theseus 1, Demosthenes 1, Brutus 1) as well some of the individual Moralia (Quaestiones conviviales and Quomodo quis suos in virtute sentiat profectus) to Senecio. These include reminiscences about Plutarch's and Senecio's conversations at Athens, Patras and Rome, as well as at Plutarch's home in Boeotia, where Senecio attended the wedding of Plutarch's son.[9]
Senecio married the daughter of Sextus Julius Frontinus, a three-time consul (cos. 97, 98, 100).[10] They had a daughter, Sosia Polla, who married Quintus Pompeius Falco.

Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), also known as Y. S. Jagan or mononymously as Jagan, is an Indian politician currently serving as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is the founder and president of the Indian political party, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. His Mother Y. S. Vijayamma, is the chairperson of YSR Congress Party.[citation needed]
Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009.[17]  After his father's death due to a helicopter crash in 2009, he started an Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) across the state.[18] He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.[19]
In 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, YSRCP won 67 seats and he became the Leader of the Opposition.[20] Five years later, in 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, he led the party to a landslide victory in the state elections by winning 151 seats of the total 175 assembly segments.[21]
Jagan Mohan Reddy was born in Christian Reddy family in Jammalamadugu in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh to Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Y. S. Vijayamma.[22][23] Reddy has a younger sister, Y. S. Sharmila, who is also a politician.[24]
He studied at The Hyderabad Public School up to 12th grade.[23] Tollywood actor Sumanth Kumar Yarlagadda was his best friend at school.[25] He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree[22][23] from Pragathi Mahavidyalaya Degree and PG college,[image 1] Ram Koti, Hyderabad.[26]
Reddy married Bharathi on 28 August 1996.[22][23] The couple has two daughters, the elder of whom studied undergraduate in London.[22][23]
Reddy first acquired Sandur Power Company Limited (SPCL), a defunct power project from its original promoter M B Ghorpade in 2001.[27] SPCL later invested crores of rupees in other companies and could acquire more businesses. It is headed by his wife, Y. S. Bharathi.[28] Reddy sold his shares in SPCL and moved away from his active direct businesses as he got more involved in politics.[citation needed]
Reddy's father Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, popularly known as YSR, was a two-time chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. He started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa district.[29] In 2009, he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency.[29]
Following the death of his father in September 2009, he started efforts to take up the political legacy left by his father. The majority of the legislators favoured him to be appointed as the Chief Minister, but this choice was not approved by party leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.
Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour), as promised earlier, to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter.[30]
Following the fallout with the Congress party high command, on 29 November 2010, he resigned from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency and has also quit the party. His mother, Vijayamma, has also resigned from Pulivendula Assembly constituency and has quit the party as well.[31] He announced on 7 December 2010 from Pulivendula that he would be starting a new party within 45 days.[32] In March 2011, he announced that he would launch the new party, named YSR Congress Party, at Jaggampeta, East Godavari district.[33] Later, his party went to by-polls in Kadapa district and won almost all the seats with a huge majority.[34] Reddy, as the president of YSR Congress, faced by-election from the Kadapa constituency and won by a large margin of 545,043 votes.[35] His mother has also won the Pulivendula Assembly constituency by 85,193 votes against Y. S. Vivekananda Reddy.[36]
In 2014, the YSR Congress Party was a pre-poll favourite among most analysts and psephologists.[37] But, the YSRCP has lost the 2014 elections, winning only 67 of 175 seats in the state assembly, with 45% of vote share.[38] The Telugu Desam Party vote share went up to 47% and the 2% gap led to the defeat of YSRCP.[37]
As a leader of the Opposition in Assembly and YSR Congress Party's president, Reddy launched his 3,000-km-long walkathon named Praja Sankalpa Yatra, popularly called padayatra, on 6 November 2017 at Idupulapaya in Kadapa district.[39][40] YSR Congress party coined a slogan "Raavali Jagan, Kaavali Jagan" (transl. Jagan should come. We want Jagan.) for the foot march that took him across 125 Assembly segments all over the state in 430 days and ended on 9 January 2019.
Reddy while boarding a flight to Hyderabad was attacked with a cock fighting knife in the VIP Lounge of Visakhapatnam Airport on 25 October 2018.[41] He received a lacerated injury on his shoulder and had to undergo a surgery.[42]
In the 2019 National and State election held in April and May 2019, YSR Congress Party swept the polls and won 151 of the total 175 assembly seats and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. He took oath as the Chief Minister on 30 May 2019.[43] His chief ministership has been marked by a slew of welfare schemes such as Jagananna Amma Vodi, Navaratnalu.[44] Jagananna Amma Vodi provides financial assistance for mothers or guardians from the Below Poverty Line, to educate their children.[45][46] Navaratnalu is a collection of nine welfare schemes covering farmers, women, medical and health, education and Special Category Status.[44] He scrapped the plans for a new capital at Amaravati, proposed by the former TDP government, and has proposed three different capitals for the judicial, administrative and legislative branches at Kurnool, Amaravati and Visakhapatnam respectively.[47] The proposal resulted in widespread protests by the farmers of Amaravati.[48] The Andhra Pradesh High Court in a March 2022 ruling directed the Government of Andhra Pradesh to continue developing Amaravati and adjudicated that the government "lacked the competence to make any legislation for shifting, bifurcating or trifurcating the capital".[49]
As of April 2023, it was reported by the Association for Democratic Reforms that he was the richest Chief Minister in India, with a total assets of 510 crore.[50][51][52]
Jagan Reddy and his family are Christians. In November 2019, the Andhra government run by Jagan Mohan Reddy hiked the financial assistance given to Christian pilgrims going to Jerusalem from Rs.40,000/- to Rs.60,000/- if their annual income was less than Rs.3 lakhs and Rs.30,000/- if their annual income was more than Rs.3 lakhs and an honorarium of Rs.5000/- per month to pastors is also being given. His government has launched housing schemes and financial assistance for the poor sections of the Christian community.[53] Jagan Reddy celebrates Christmas every year with his family at his hometown's Church.[54][55]
On 27 May 2012, Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on embezzlement charges. CBI summoned Reddy for allegedly amassing huge assets through illegal means by using his father's office, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, when he was the chief minister. CBI and ED has also summoned 58 companies of investing in Reddy's businesses, for the favours they allegedly received in the form of mining leases, allotments of projects.[56] His judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded.[57][58][59] The Supreme Court of India dismissed his Bail petition on 4 July 2012,[60][61] 9 August 2012, 7 November 2012,[62] 9 May 2013,[63] 13 May 2013.[64][65]
The YSR Congress Party and Reddy's family have been alleging a political conspiracy behind Reddy's investigations.[66][67] While in jail, Reddy started a hunger strike opposing the United Progressive Alliance's decision to endorse the creation of a separate Telangana state. After 125 hours of indefinite hunger strike, his sugar levels and blood pressure were down. He was moved to Osmania General Hospital for treatment.[68][69][70] His mother, Vijayamma, was also on hunger strike protesting the formation of Telangana.

Sian Louise Massey-Ellis MBE (née Massey; born 5 October 1985)[2][3] is an English football match official who officiates generally in the role of assistant referee in the Premier League and the Football League. She has also been appointed to matches in the Football League Trophy, UEFA Women's Champions League,[4] FIFA Women's World Cup qualification rounds, the FIFA Women's World Cup and the UEFA Europa League. Massey-Ellis was appointed to the FIFA list of women assistant referees in 2009 and turned professional in 2010.[5][6][7]
Career
Domestic career
In May 2009, Massey-Ellis was appointed fourth official for the year's FA Women's Cup final at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium, a game which saw two injury-time goals and Arsenal defeat Sunderland 2–1.[9] In the 2009–10 men's season Massey was fourth official in five matches and assistant referee in 11 matches. Her first appointment as an assistant referee was on 29 August 2009, a 2–2 draw between Hereford United and Port Vale.[10]
On 11 February 2010, Massey-Ellis refereed the season's FA Women's Premier League Cup final between Leeds Carnegie and Everton at Rochdale's Spotland Stadium. Massey was required to interpret two notable incidents; she disallowed a third first-half goal for Leeds for a foul on Everton's goalkeeper and disregarded Everton's late first-half appeal for a penalty kick. Leeds won the match 3–1, winning the cup for the first time since its inaugural 1991–92 season.[11]
Massey-Ellis turned professional in March 2010, joining the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOB), who provide the officials for men's Premier League matches, the highest level of professional football in England. Her first Premier League appointment was on 28 December 2010, as an assistant in Blackpool's 2–0 away win at Sunderland.
During a game between Cardiff City and Middlesbrough in May 2011, Massey was knocked over by Cardiff player Kevin McNaughton, although the incident was said, officially by the FA, to be an accident.[12]
In August 2011, Massey-Ellis was appointed to the Select Group of match officials.[13]
Massey-Ellis was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to football.[14]
Sexism controversy
After her second Premier League game, as an assistant in Liverpool's 3–0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2011, a sexism controversy erupted over remarks made about Massey-Ellis by staff of the Premier League broadcaster Sky Sports, which led to commentator Andy Gray and presenter Richard Keys being sacked.[15][16][17] Reporter Andy Burton was suspended. Massey-Ellis was withdrawn by the PGMOB from her next appointment, a League 2 game between Crewe Alexandra and Bradford City on 25 January, as they believed the added attention Massey might receive could detract from the match itself.[7][18][19][20] The PGMOB also withdrew her for a second time, from a Conference North game between Corby Town and Eastwood Town on 29 January, with Corby stating there had been huge demand for television access when it was announced Massey was to referee the game.[21] Massey returned to the line on 5 February for a League 2 match between Chesterfield and Aldershot Town, and was then appointed to her third Premier League fixture on 12 February between Blackpool and Aston Villa, as an assistant to Howard Webb.[citation needed]
Massey-Ellis was the subject of censorship by Iranian state TV broadcasters when she was an assistant referee for a 12 April 2021 Premier League game between Manchester United and Tottenham. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting reportedly cut away from the game more than 100 times in order to avoid showing her legs, showing outdoor footage of London instead. Massey-Ellis was wearing shorts, and women are required to cover their legs and hair in public by Iranian law. Activist group My Stealthy Freedom publicly complained about the censorship. The channel allegedly had previously cancelled showing a 2019 match between Augsburg and Bayern Munich because a female referee would be officiating, and edited a broadcast of the 2018 FIFA World Cup draw announcement due to co-host Maria Komandnaya.[22]

Félix-Alexandre Guilmant (French: [gilmɑ̃]; 12 March 1837 – 29 March 1911) was a French organist and composer. He was the organist of La Trinité from 1871 until 1901. A noted pedagogue, performer, and improviser, Guilmant helped found the Schola Cantorum de Paris. He was appointed as Professor of Organ at the Paris Conservatoire in 1896.[1]
Biography
Guilmant was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer. A student first of his father Jean-Baptiste and later of the Belgian master Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, he became an organist and teacher in his place of birth.
In 1871 he was appointed to play the organ regularly at la Trinité church in Paris, and this position, organiste titulaire, was one he held for 30 years.[2] Guilmant was known for his improvisations, both in the concert and church setting. His inspiration came from gregorian chants, and he was greatly noted amongst his colleagues for his mastery of the melodies.[1]  From then on, Guilmant followed a career as a virtuoso; he gave concerts in the United States (the first major French organist to tour that country), and in Canada, as well as in Europe, making especially frequent visits to England. His American achievements included a 1904 series of no fewer than 40 recitals on the largest organ in the world, the St. Louis Exposition Organ, now preserved as the nucleus of Philadelphia's Wanamaker Organ.
With his younger colleague André Pirro, Guilmant published a collection of scores, Archives des Maîtres de l'Orgue (Archives of the Masters of the Organ), a compilation of the compositions of numerous pre-1750 French composers. The collection was printed in ten volumes, the first in 1898 and the last (which Guilmant did not live to finalize) in 1914.  Guilmant provided a rather similar survey of organ pieces by foreign composers, publishing l'École classique de l'Orgue (Classical School of the Organ). These anthologies, despite all the musicological developments which have taken place since Guilmant's own time, remain very valuable sources of early music.
In 1894 Guilmant founded the Schola Cantorum with Charles Bordes and Vincent d'Indy. He taught there up until his death at his home in Meudon, near Paris, in 1911. In addition, he taught at the Conservatoire de Paris where he succeeded Charles-Marie Widor as organ teacher in 1896.[2]  As a teacher, Guilmant was noted for his kindness and attention to detail.  His students' recollections feature accounts of a particular focus on all facets of a note: attack, release, character.[3] Marcel Dupré was the most celebrated of his many students.  Others included Augustin Barié, Joseph-Arthur Bernier, Joseph Bonnet, Alexandre Eugène Cellier, Abel Decaux, Gabriel Dupont, Charles Henry Galloway, Philip Hale, Edgar Henrichsen, Édouard Mignan, and Émile Poillot. See: List of music students by teacher: G to J#Alexandre Guilmant.
Guilmant's interest in Marcel Dupré began when the latter was a child. Albert Dupré, father of the celebrated Marcel, studied organ with Guilmant for seven years prior to his son's birth.  In Dupré's memoirs, he includes an anecdote where Guilmant visits his mother upon his birth and declares that the child will grow up to be an organist.  After frequent visits throughout his childhood, Marcel Dupré began studying with Guilmant formally at age 11.  From this time until his death, Guilmant championed the young virtuoso and did much to advance his career.[4] Guilmant's house was later purchased then demolished by Dupré and rebuilt. His home organ was also sold to Dupré.
Compositions
Guilmant was an accomplished and extremely prolific composer. Unlike Widor, who produced a great deal of music in all the main genres, Guilmant devoted himself almost entirely to works for his own instrument, the organ. His organ output includes: 'Pièces dans différents styles', published in 18 books; 'L'organiste pratique', published in 12 books; Eighteen 'Pièces Nouvelles'; and 'L'Organiste liturgique', published in 10 books. Guilmant's Eight Sonatas were conceived with the Cavaillé-Coll organ of La Trinité in mind, and are therefore symphonic in style and form, taking their place alongside the symphonic organ works of César Franck and the Organ Symphonies of Charles-Marie Widor.
The Sonate No. 1/Symphonie No. 1 for organ and orchestra, Op. 42, was programmed by Sergei Koussevitzky in the 1930s, but was not heard again until Igor Buketoff revived it for a 1977 live recording with the Butler University Orchestra (note, the composer's name is misspelled "Gilmont" in the source).[5]
Though few in number, his works for instruments besides the organ have not been entirely neglected. For example, the Morceau Symphonique is one of the most frequently performed trombone solos, enjoying longstanding popularity among both professional and advanced student trombonists.

António de Oliveira Salazar[a] GCTE GCSE GColIH GCIC (/ˌsæləˈzɑːr/, US also /ˌsɑːl-/, Portuguese: [ɐ̃ˈtɔni.u ðɨ ɔliˈvɐjɾɐ sɐlɐˈzaɾ]; 28 April 1889 – 27 July 1970) was a Portuguese academic, economist and politician who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1932 to 1968. Having come to power under the Ditadura Nacional ("National Dictatorship"), he reframed the regime as the corporatist Estado Novo ("New State"), with himself as a dictator. The regime he created lasted until 1974, making it one of the longest-lived authoritarian regimes in Europe.
A political economy professor at the University of Coimbra, Salazar entered public life as finance minister with the support of President Óscar Carmona after the 28 May 1926 coup d'état. The military of 1926 saw themselves as the guardians of the nation in the wake of the instability and perceived failure of the First Republic, but they had no idea how to address the critical challenges of the hour.[1] Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilised Portugal's currency. Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses.[2] He promoted civilian administration in the authoritarian regime when the politics of more and more countries were becoming militarised.[1] Salazar's aim was the de-politicisation of society, rather than the mobilisation of the populace.[1] However, Portugal remained largely underdeveloped, its population relatively poor and with low education attainment when compared to the rest of Europe.[3]
Opposed to communism, socialism, syndicalism and liberalism, Salazar's rule was conservative, corporatist and nationalist in nature; it was also capitalist to some extent although in a very conditioned way until the beginning of the final stage of his rule, in the 1960s.[4] Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he described as a "pagan Caesarism" that did not recognise legal, religious or moral limits.[5] Throughout his life Salazar avoided populist rhetoric.[6] He was generally opposed to the concept of political parties when, in 1930, he created the National Union. Salazar described and promoted the party as a "non-party",[7] and announced that the National Union would be the antithesis of a political party.[7] He promoted Catholicism but argued that the role of the Church was social, not political, and negotiated the Concordat of 1940 that kept the church at arm's length. One of the mottos of the Salazar regime was Deus, Pátria e Família ("God, Fatherland and Family"), although he never turned Portugal into a confessional state.[8][9]
With the Estado Novo enabling him to exercise vast political powers, Salazar used censorship and the PIDE secret police to quell opposition. One opposition leader, Humberto Delgado, who openly challenged Salazar's regime in the 1958 presidential election, was first exiled and then killed by Salazar's secret police. Salazar supported Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War and played a key role in keeping Portugal and Spain neutral during World War II while still providing aid and assistance to the Allies.[10][11][12] Despite being a dictatorship, Portugal under his rule took part in the founding of some international organisations. The country was one of the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, joined the European Payments Union in 1950 and was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960; it was also a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961. Under Salazar's rule, Portugal also joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1961 and began the Portuguese Colonial War. The doctrine of pluricontinentalism was the basis of Salazar's territorial policy, a conception of the Portuguese Empire as a unified state that spanned multiple continents. After Salazar fell into a coma in 1968, President Américo Tomás dismissed him from the position of prime minister.[13]
The Estado Novo collapsed during the Carnation Revolution of 1974, four years after Salazar's death. In recent decades, "new sources and methods are being employed by Portuguese historians in an attempt to come to grips with the dictatorship which lasted forty-eight years."[14]
Background
Family
Salazar was born in Vimieiro, near Santa Comba Dão (Viseu District), to a family of modest income on 28 April 1889.[15] His father, a small landowner, had started as an agricultural labourer and became the manager for the Perestrelos, a wealthy family of rural landowners of the region of Santa Comba Dão who possessed lands and other assets scattered between Viseu and Coimbra.[16] Salazar's birthplace in Santa Comba Dão.
He was the only male child of two fifth cousins, António de Oliveira (1839–1932) and his wife Maria do Resgate Salazar (1845–1926).[15] According to Portuguese naming customs, which place the mother's surname first, Salazar's name would have been "António Salazar de Oliveira" – a pattern followed by his four sisters – but, for reasons that remain unclear,[b] the order of his surnames was reversed, and he thus became "António de Oliveira Salazar".[17]  His four older sisters were Maria do Resgate Salazar de Oliveira, an elementary school teacher; Elisa Salazar de Oliveira; Maria Leopoldina Salazar de Oliveira; and Laura Salazar de Oliveira, who in 1887 married Abel Pais de Sousa, brother of Mário Pais de Sousa [pt], who served as Salazar's Interior Minister.
Education
Salazar attended the primary school in his small village and later went to another primary school in Viseu. At age 11, he won a free place at Viseu's seminary, where he studied for eight years, from 1900 to 1908.[18] Salazar considered becoming a priest, but like many who entered the seminary very young, he decided not to proceed to the priesthood after receiving holy orders.[18] He went to Coimbra in 1910 during the first years of the Portuguese First Republic to study law at the University of Coimbra.[19] During these student years in Coimbra, he developed a particular interest in finance and graduated in law with distinction, specialising in finance and economic policy. He graduated in 1914, with 19 points out of 20,[20] and in the meantime, became an assistant professor of economic policy at the Law School. In 1917, he assumed the chairs of economic policy and finance at the university by appointment of professor José Alberto dos Reis. In the following year, Salazar was awarded his doctorate.[20]
Politics and Estado Novo
Background
Salazar was twenty-one years old at the time of the revolution of 5 October 1910, which overthrew the Portuguese monarchy and instituted the First Portuguese Republic. The political institutions of the First Republic lasted until 1926, when it was replaced by a military dictatorship. This was first known as the "Ditadura Militar" (Military Dictatorship) and then, from 1928, as the "Ditadura Nacional" (National Dictatorship).
The era of the First Republic has been described as one of "continual anarchy, government corruption, rioting and pillage, assassinations, arbitrary imprisonment and religious persecution".[21] It witnessed the inauguration of eight presidents, 44 cabinet re-organisations and 21 revolutions.[22][21] The first government of the Republic lasted less than 10 weeks and the longest-ruling government lasted little over a year. Revolution in Portugal became a byword in Europe. The cost of living increased twenty-fivefold, while the currency fell to a 1⁄33 part of its gold value. Portugal's public finances entered a critical phase, having been under imminent threat of default since at least the 1890s.[23][24] The gaps between the rich and the poor continued t

Early life and education
Jidenna Theodore Mobisson was born on May 4, 1985, in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin,[6] [7][8] to Tama Mobisson, an accountant, and Oliver Mobisson, a Nigerian Igbo academic.

She studied acting at the Caymichael Patten Studio in New York,[8] and in 1999, made her TV debut as Natasha in HBO's romantic comedy Sex and the City.[11] She later had a recurring role in the show, until the divorce of her character from Mr. Big (Chris Noth).[12] The following year, she appeared in smaller film roles, including having parts in In the Weeds and Whipped.[8]
Breakthrough
Moynahan made her feature-film debut in the 2000 comedy-drama Coyote Ugly as Rachel, a bartender and dancer in a wild New York bar,[13] a role considered her breakthrough.[14] She accepted the role because she "thought it was interesting that the whole movie revolved around five women…and my character was so strong and independent."[11] The film received generally unfavorable reviews,[15] but was a box-office success, earning $133 million worldwide.[16] Her next role was a supporting role in 2001 film Serendipity as Hally, the fiancée of John Cusack's character.[17]
Moynahan began studying acting under Iris Klein, focusing on scene study and technique [1].  Moynahan worked opposite Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman in the action film The Sum of All Fears, based on Tom Clancy's book of the same name.[18] She played Dr. Catherine Muller, a love interest for Affleck's Jack Ryan.[19] Dave Larsen of the Dayton Daily News reported the subplot involving Moynahan and Affleck was "the film's weakest point".[20] The film received ambivalent reviews,[21] but was a commercial success, earning $193 million at the box office.[22] Moynahan's next role was as a CIA trainee in The Recruit (2003).[23] The movie was poorly received,[24] with Mike Clark of USA Today calling it "a less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend".[25]
In 2004, Moynahan worked alongside Will Smith in Alex Proyas' science-fiction movie I, Robot, loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short-story collection of the same name.[26] She portrayed Dr. Susan Calvin, a specialist in robot psychology.[27] The film received mixed reviews,[28] though critics enjoyed Moynahan's performance. Daniel Neman of Richmond Times-Dispatch disliked the film, concluding that Moynahan "turns in an able performance as Dr. Calvin, the convenient character."[29] With revenue of $347 million worldwide, the film remains Moynahan's most commercially successful picture to date.[30] Her next movie was 2005's Lord of War, a political crime thriller, where she played Ava Fontaine Orlov, the wife of Nicolas Cage's character.[31] In 2006, Maxim  named Moynahan #96 on its annual "Hot 100" list.[32]
In September 2006, away from film, Moynahan worked as Whitney Crane in the ABC television drama series Six Degrees co-starring with Jay Hernandez, Erika Christensen, Hope Davis, Dorian Missick, and Campbell Scott.[33] The series centered on six residents of New York City and their relationships and connections with one another, based on the idea of six degrees of separation.[34] It debuted on September 20, 2006, and was watched by almost 13.3 million viewers.[35] It debuted to varied reception,[36] with David Hinckley of the New York Daily News writing, "In theory, it's an intriguing concept for a series. But in practice, Six Degrees doesn't work at all in drawing you in at the start."[36] After one season, it was cancelled in May 2007.[37]
Moynahan's next film role was in the November 2006 thriller Unknown, about a group of individuals kidnapped and trying to escape their captors together.[38] She was next seen in 2007, in Gray Matters, working with Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh,[39] before being cast in Henry Bean's comedy-drama Noise as Helen Owen, the wife of David Owen (Tim Robbins).[40] The movie was screened at a special presentation at the 2007 Rome Film Festival[41] and released in theaters in 2008.[42]
In December 2008, Moynahan guest-starred in two episodes of the ABC television comedy-drama Eli Stone as the titular character's (Jonny Lee Miller) ex-girlfriend.[43] Returning to film, she appeared in Ramona and Beezus, as the mother to Joey King and Selena Gomez's characters.[44] The film was directed by Elizabeth Allen and released in July 2010. The next year, Moynahan worked with Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez and Michael Peña in the action science-fiction feature Battle: Los Angeles (2011),[45] and starred in the CBS television show Blue Bloods, playing Assistant District Attorney Erin Reagan[46] together with Donnie Wahlberg, who had encouraged her to take the role after working with her on a 2008 TV pilot called Bunker Hill.[47]
In November 2009, she signed a deal with Garnier to appear in television and print advertising promoting their Ultra-Lift skincare products.[48]
In 2014, Moynahan appeared as the late wife of the title character in the action film John Wick,[49] and appearing in the 2017 sequel. Most recently, in 2019, she starred in the action film Crown Vic.
Personal life
She dated NFL quarterback Tom Brady from 2004 to 2006.[51] On February 18, 2007, Moynahan's representative confirmed that she was more than three months pregnant and that Brady was the father.[52] On August 22, 2007, she gave birth to their son.[53][54]
In 2010, she moved from Pacific Palisades, California, to New York City when she was cast in Blue Bloods. Moynahan was in a brief relationship with director McG in the late 2010’s.[55]
On October 17, 2015, she married businessman Andrew Frankel at a ceremony in the Hamptons.[56][57] Moynahan is the stepmother to Frankel’s three sons from a previous

Ji Sung (Korean: 지성; born Kwak Tae-geun on 27 February 1977) is a South Korean actor. He is best known for his roles in the television dramas All In (2003), Save the Last Dance for Me (2004), New Heart (2007), Protect the Boss (2011),  Secret Love (2013), Kill Me, Heal Me (2015), Innocent Defendant (2017), Familiar Wife (2018), Doctor John (2019), The Devil Judge (2021) and the film  My PS Partner (2012).
Early life
Kwak Tae-geun's parents were both educators, and they expected him to also enter the teaching profession. But in his sophomore year in high school, his father bought him a VCR and the first movie he rented was Rain Man. Dustin Hoffman's acting left such an impression on him that he decided to become an actor, despite his father's objections.[1][2] He later studied Theater and Film at Hanyang University.
Career
1999–2002: Beginnings
Ji Sung first auditioned for the 1999 campus drama KAIST, where he met screenwriter Song Ji-na. Song took an interest in the young upstart and wrote a new character for him, leading to his acting debut.[1] Upon the suggestion of his then-manager, he began using the stage name Chae Ji-sung, then decided to drop the surname "Chae," and became known simply as "Ji Sung"[1] After several minor roles, he began playing bigger parts, notably in the television dramas Wonderful Days (2001) and Sunshine Hunting 2002),[3][4] as well as the North-South romantic comedy film Whistling Princess (2002).[5]
2003–2004: Breakthrough
Ji was then cast in the 2003 gambling drama All In.[6] Producers were having difficulty casting the second male lead because most actors were afraid to be compared to lead actor Lee Byung-hun. Ji Sung approached director Yoo Chul-yong, saying he wanted the role.[1] All In was a big hit, and Ji Sung's popularity rose and became known as a Hallyu star.[7] Wanting to challenge himself, he next appeared in his first period drama The King's Woman, playing Gwanghaegun of Joseon.[8]
In Save the Last Dance for Me (2004), he played a rich amnesiac businessman who falls in love with a girl running a bed and breakfast who nurses him back to health (played by Eugene).[9]
He then made a guest appearance playing Bae Jong-ok's college boyfriend in "Outing", a two-episode arc written by Lee Kyung-hee for the omnibus drama Beating Heart (2005),[10] followed by a supporting role in Kim Dae-seung's period thriller Blood Rain (2005).[11][12]
2005–2007: Enlistment
Ji Sung enlisted on 7 June 2005, for his mandatory military service. Though he initially enlisted as an ordinary soldier,[13] the Military Manpower Administration transferred him to the military promotion ("entertainers") unit in February 2006, for which he served as "public ambassador of military affairs".[14] He was discharged on 6 June 2007.[15]
2008–2014: Comeback and lead roles
He made his comeback in the medical drama New Heart (2007–08), playing a cardiothoracic surgery resident.[16] During a scene where his character cries after failing to save the life of a former comfort woman, Ji Sung said he thought of his maternal grandmother who'd recently died, remembering that she'd told him her only pleasure was watching him in reruns of All In. Contrary to his cheeky, playful character, Ji Sung said that he's taciturn and shy in real life, but that the drama made him find a different side of himself.[17]
He then made an extended cameo as the sophisticated right-hand man of the mob boss in action noir Fate (2008).[18]
In 2009, Ji Sung collaborated again with writer Choi Wan-kyu and director Yoo Chul-yong of All In in the revenge drama 
Swallow the Sun, adapted from the novel by Kang Chul-hwa, and shot on location in Jeju Island, Las Vegas and South Africa. Ji Sung trained hard to play the tough, strong-willed protagonist who goes to prison for his boss and later becomes involved in the city development of Jeju.[19][20]
In February 2010, he signed with a new management agency, Namoo Actors.[21] Several months later, he played another historical character in Kim Su-ro, The Iron King, as the titular founder of Geumgwan Gaya.[22][23][24]
In 2011, Ji Sung starred alongside Yum Jung-ah in Royal Family, about the power plays within a chaebol family.[25] Later that year, he was cast in the workplace romantic comedy Protect the Boss.[26] In a departure from his usual serious roles, Ji Sung played a dorky man-child with a panic disorder, who matures and learns to run his father's business after meeting a feisty secretary (played by Choi Kang-hee).[27][28][29]
From 2012 to 2013, Ji Sung played a gifted seer/geomancer in The Great Seer. His fictional character becomes a "kingmaker" to Yi Seong-gye (played by Ji Jin-hee), the general who leads the overthrow of Goryeo and establishes the Joseon Dynasty, becoming its first king Taejo.[30]
In late 2012, he starred in adult romantic comedy My PS Partner, playing an aspiring singer-songwriter trying to get over a breakup, who becomes the wrong recipient of a phone sex call from a woman (played by Kim Ah-joong) trying to seduce her boyfriend into proposing.[31] Ji Sung said he found the script intriguing, despite the discomfort of appearing in bed scenes. And after he saw Love & Other Drugs, he wanted to be in a movie that portrayed a romantic relationship in a realistic manner.[32]
In 2013, Ji Sung starred in  melodrama Secret Love. He said he chose the drama because he found the script "fresh, honest, and sophisticated."[33] He played a chaebol "bad boy" whose girlfriend is killed, then falls for the woman who went to prison for the crime.[34] Ji Sung next appeared in Confession, a 2014 neo-noir film that brutally explores the aftermath of three men's friendship after the death of one's mother.[2][35]
2015–present: Career resurgence
In 2015, he reunited with Secret Love co-star Hwang Jung-eum in Kill Me, Heal Me, in which he played a chaebol millionaire with dissociative identity disorder formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder from DSMIV-TR who has seven different identities.[36][37][38][39] The series was a hit and developed a cult following, winning Ji Sung the "Daesang (Grand Prize)" at the MBC Drama Awards.[40]
However, Ji's next work Entertainer, where he played a cunning and self-centered manager of an entertainment company, failed to be successful.[41] Ji bounced back in 2017 with legal thriller Innocent Defendant, which was a hit and topped viewership ratings.[42] Ji earned acclaim for playing the diverse emotions of the character, an amnesic prosecutor who finds himself on a death row.[43] He received the Grand Prize award at the SBS Drama Awards.[44]
In 2018, Ji starred in the fantasy romance comedy drama Familiar Wife.[45] The same year he starred in the period comedy film Feng Shui.[46]
In 2019, Ji starred television series Doctor John.[47] It is his first medical drama in 11 years.[48]
In 2020, Ji appeared in tvN's travel show RUN alongside Kang Ki-young, Lee Tae-sun and Hwang Hee.[49]
In 2021, Ji Sung starred in the mystery legal drama The Devil Judge with his previous co-star Kim Min-jung who he worked together 13 years ago in the drama New Heart. In August 2021, Namoo Actors' contract expired and Ji Sung decided not to renew it.[50][51]
In January 2022, Ji-sung signed an exclusive contract with Surpass Entertainment.[52] He starred in a mystery drama called Adamas, which aired from 27 July to 15 September 2022. Ji Sung played the roles of the twin brothers who pair up to uncover the mystery of a murder that occurred 22 years ago.
Personal life
He met actress Lee Bo-young on the set of 2004 TV series Save Last Dance for Me, and they confirmed their relationship in 2007.[53][54][55][56] On 2 August 2013, the couple announced their engagement by uploading handwritten letters on their respective official fan sites.[57][58][59][60][61] They married at Aston House, W Seoul Walkerhill Hotel on 27 September 2013.[62][63][64] Their first child, a daughter named Kwak Ji-yoo, was born on 13 June 2015.[65] Their second child, a son named Kwak Woo-sung, was born on 5 February 2019.[66]

Annika Charlotta Sörenstam (pronounced [ˈǎnːɪka ˈsœ̂ːrɛnˌstam] ⓘ; born 9 October 1970) is a  Swedish professional golfer.  She is regarded as one of the best female golfers in history.[2] Before stepping away from competitive golf at the end of the 2008 season, she had won 90 international tournaments as a professional, making her the female golfer with the most wins to her name. She has won 72 official LPGA tournaments including ten majors and 24 other tournaments internationally. After turning 50, she came back from her retirement and added a win in the 2021 U.S. Senior Women's Open.
In 2003, she achieved a career grand slam, winning, at least once in her career, each of the four tournaments recognized as major championships during the main part of her career.
Despite retiring from regular tournament golf in 2008, as of the end of 2022, she still topped the LPGA's career money list with earnings of over $22 million—over $2 million ahead of her nearest rival while playing 187 fewer events.[3]
The winner of a record eight Player of the Year awards, and six Vare Trophies given to the LPGA player with the lowest seasonal scoring average, she is the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition. She holds various all-time scoring records including the lowest season scoring average: 68.6969 in 2004.
Representing Europe in the Solheim Cup on eight occasions between 1994 and 2007, Sörenstam was the event's all-time leading points earner until her record was surpassed by England's Laura Davies during the 2011 Solheim Cup. Sörenstam also was captain of the 2017 European Solheim Cup team.
In 2003, Sörenstam played in the Bank of America Colonial tournament to become the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since 1945.
On 7 January 2021, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.
Childhood and amateur career
She was born in Bro near Stockholm, Sweden.[4] Sörenstam's father Tom was an IBM executive and her mother Gunilla worked in a bank. Her younger sister Charlotta, also became a professional golfer and LPGA Tour winner, and, after her playing career, coached at her sister's academy.[5] Annika and Charlotta Sörenstam became the first two sisters to both win $1 million on the LPGA Tour.
As a child, Sörenstam was a talented all-around athlete. She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played association football (soccer) in her hometown team Bro IK, and was such a good skier that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.[4][6][7]
Junior golf
The Sörenstam family began playing golf at Viksjö Golf Club in Jakobsberg, north of Stockholm and later switched to nearby Bro-Bålsta Golf Club, opened in 1980, initially with a 9-hole course. At the age of 12, Annika shared her first set of golf clubs with her sister. Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even - and earned her first handicap of 54.[4]
At the European Tour tournament Scandinavian Enterprise Open in Stockholm in July 1986, she tried to be a volunteer caddie and was asked to stand in a line with all other candidates. When all male volunteer caddies finally had been chosen by the tournament professionals, three teen-age girls were left without a bag yet. It was Annika, Charlotta and Fanny Sunesson.[8]
She was so shy as a junior, she used to deliberately three-putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech.[9] The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.[4]
Swedish national team
Her successful amateur career included a win in the St Rule Trophy played at St Andrews and a runner-up finish in the Swedish national mother/daughter Championship.[10][11] As a member of the Swedish National Team from 1987 to 1992, she played in the 1990 and 1992 Espirito Santo Trophy, winning the individual competition in 1992.[12][13] While waiting to start college in Sweden, Sörenstam worked as a personal assistant at the Swedish PGA and played on the Swedish Golf Tour, winning three tournaments during 1990/1991.[14][15][16][17]
University of Arizona
After a coach spotted Sörenstam playing in a collegiate event in Tokyo, she moved to the U.S. to play college golf at the University of Arizona in Tucson.[4] She won seven collegiate titles and in 1991, became the first non-American and first freshman to win the individual NCAA Division I Championship.[11][18] Sörenstam was 1991 NCAA Co-Player of the Year with Kelly Robbins, runner-up in the 1992 NCAA championship, 1992 Pac-10 champion and a 1991–92 NCAA All-American.[4][19][20] She qualified for the U.S. Women's Open at Oakmont in July, made the cut, and tied for 63rd. A few weeks later at the U.S. Women's Amateur at Kemper Lakes near Chicago, she was the runner-up to Vicki Goetze, bogeying the last hole in the 36-hole final.[21][22][23]
Professional career
1990s
Sörenstam turned professional in 1992, but missed her LPGA Tour card at the final qualifying tournament by one shot, and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour (LET), formerly known as the WPGET.[4] She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993, where she finished T38th, 4th, and T9th, earning more than $47,000.[24] She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year.[25] By tying for 28th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non-exempt status for the 1994 season.[4] Sörenstam's first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women's Australian Open on the ALPG Tour.[26]
In the United States, Sörenstam was LPGA Rookie of the Year, had three top-10 finishes including a tie for second at the Women's British Open and made her Solheim Cup debut.[25][27] Her breakout year was 1995, when she won her first LPGA Tour title at the U.S. Women's Open.[4] She finished at the top of the Money List[28] and was the first non-American winner of the Vare Trophy.[29] She became the second player ever to be Player of the Year and Vare Trophy winner the year after being Rookie of the Year.[30] A win at the 1995 Australian Ladies Masters[31] and two other wins on the Ladies European Tour put her top of the LET Order of Merit and made her the first player to top both the European and LPGA Tour money lists in the same season.[25][32] Her success worldwide resulted in her winning the Jerringpriset award in Sweden,[33] as well as being awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal, the country's most prestigious award in sports.[34]
1996 saw Sörenstam win her home LET tournament, the Trygg Hansa Ladies' Open in Sweden and three LPGA tournaments including the U.S. Women's Open.[35] In defending her title, she became the first non-American to win back to back U.S. Women's Open titles,[4] passed the $1 million mark in LPGA career earnings, and won her second consecutive Vare Trophy.[24]
She won six tour events in 1997, regaining the money list and player of the year titles. Internationally, she won on the JLPGA and defended her home LET title at the renamed Compaq Open. She became the first player in LPGA history to finish a season with a sub-70 scoring average of 69.99 en route to retaining the 1998 Player of the Year and Money List titles as well as winning the LET Swedish tour stop for the third time running.[29] September 1999 saw Sörenstam change her on-course team replacing her caddie of six years, Colin Cann, with Terry McNamara.[36][37]
2000s
At this point in her career, Sörenstam says she lost focus having reached her biggest goals.[4] Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam still managed to win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s.[30] She qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch's/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003.[38][39] Sörenstam was the first international player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame through the LPGA criteria.[40][41][42]
Having lost her preeminent position, Sörenstam embarked on a new five-da

Paul O'Neill (born 31 December 1979) is a British auto racing driver, and the half-brother of English singer Melanie C.[1]
Career
Early years
Born in Widnes, Cheshire, O'Neill was originally attracted to racing after seeing Nigel Mansell win the 1987 British Grand Prix, but did not pursue a career initially, studying for A-Levels but not completing them. After attending the Jim Russell racing school, he began racing in the MGF cup in 1999 and 2000, before entering the production class of the British Touring Car Championship in 2001. He did not win a race, but took 3 class podiums and 2 class poles en route to 8th in the class.
British Touring Car Championship
Vauxhall (2002–2003)
His efforts in the production class were enough to earn him a drive with Team Egg Sport in their semi-works Touring Class Vauxhall Astra Coupe for 2002. He was 8th in this championship, and then stepped up to the factory Vauxhall team for 2003, finishing 4th in the series.
Tech-Speed and Motorbase (2004–2007)
He was not expected to retain the drive for 2004, but early that year he discovered that he had diabetes, and his racing licence was temporarily withdrawn. Once the condition was under control he did not immediately resume racing, instead helping his former team Tech-Speed prepare their bio-ethanol powered car, tutoring driver Fiona Leggate and fulfilling the post of race engineer. He also raced the guest car in the Porsche Carrera Cup at Oulton Park in 2006 along with some Ginettas Racing.
Following Leggate's premature departure from Tech-Speed, O'Neill signed for the team to compete in the final two race weekends of the 2006 British Touring Car Championship season. This car is powered by sugar beet, which he is not permitted to eat because of his diabetes. He scored a 10th place in his first race back. Notably, while most drivers at this September Brands Hatch meeting were slower than they had been at the April meeting due to different track conditions, O'Neill was over a second faster than Leggate's time from that meeting in some practice sessions. At Silverstone he was hampered by engine issues in practice[2] but took 2 top 10 finishes on raceday. He did not keep the drive for 2007, Techspeed opting instead to unite with the Turkish Arkas team and run Erkut Kızılırmak. He competed in the final round of 2007 with Motorbase Performance in a SEAT Toledo.
Tech-Speed (2009–2011)
O'Neill driving the Tech-Speed Motorsport Honda Integra at Oulton Park during the 2010 British Touring Car Championship season.
O'Neill returned to Tech-Speed for the 2009 British Touring Car Championship season, partnering Martyn Bell in a two-car team. He scored a third place at Snetterton, and as of round seven at Knockhill he had scored points in 11 successive races.[3] He was placed 10th in the Drivers Championship.
O'Neill remained with Tech-Speed for the 2010 & 2011 seasons, now joined by John George. He finished 9th (2010) and 10th (2011) claiming 5 podiums.
Speedworks Motorsport (2012)
He was without a regular drive at the start of the 2012 season, but drove the Speedworks Motorsport Toyota Avensis at Croft and Knockhill, deputising for the team's regular driver Tony Hughes, who was unable to take part due to his business commitments. He was unable to secure the finances required to stay with the team for 2013.[4]
Tony Gilham Racing (2013)
Having been without a drive since the start of the 2013 season, O'Neill joined Tony Gilham Racing for the Knockhill round driving an RCIB Insurance Racing Vauxhall Insignia when regular driver Jack Goff decided to miss the round.[5]
British GT Championship
O'Neill entered the Croft round of the British GT Championship towards the end of 2007 alongside co-driver Steve Clark in a Team RPM Viper Competition Coupe GT3. He returned to the series in 2008 with Team RPM driving a Viper Competition Coupe in the GT3 class.[6] He competed in the first eight races of the season, including a win in the second race at Rockingham. He finished the season 16th in the GT3 standings.
Other activities
O'Neill is a motor racing instructor at the Oulton Park circuit in Cheshire.[when?]
Since 2012, he has been part of the presenting team for the ITV4 television coverage of the BTCC.
In 2013 he appeared on the British television series Top Gear, driving a Volkswagen Beetle in a taxi race.
In 2014, he appeared in series 2 of Classic Car Rescue, driving and valuing the restored cars. He also competed in one round of the Mazda MX-5 SuperCup at Oulton Park, taking two wins.[7]
Paul O'Neill is a Patron of The Sporting Memories Foundation and on 10 September 2017 completed the Great North Run to raise funds for the charity.
O'Neill is also a driver coach for Britcar class champion Tim Docker.[8] O'Neill volunteered as a marshal at the seventh round of the Britcar Endurance Championship at Oulton Park.

Eliza Patricia Dushku (/ˈdʊʃkuː/;[1] born December 30, 1980)[2] is an American actress. She is best known for starring as Faith in the supernatural drama series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1998–2003) and its spin-off series Angel (2000–2003).[3] She also had lead roles in the Fox supernatural drama series Tru Calling (2003–2005) and the Fox science fiction series Dollhouse (2009–2010), for which she was a producer.[4]
Dushku had starring roles in various films, including True Lies (1994), Bye Bye Love (1995), Bring It On (2000), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), The New Guy (2002), Wrong Turn (2003), On Broadway (2007), The Scribbler (2014), Jane Wants a Boyfriend (2015), and Eloise (2016).[5] She has also done voice work for numerous video games and animated films.
Early life
Dushku was born in Boston and raised in Watertown, Massachusetts,[2] the only daughter and youngest of the four children of school teacher and administrator Philip Richard George Dushku and Judy Dushku (née Rasmussen),[2][6] a political science professor.[7] Dushku's father was Boston-born, of Albanian heritage, with his parents coming from the city of Korçë,[8] and her mother, from Idaho, is of Danish, English, Irish and German descent.[9][better source needed]
Dushku's mother was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Dushku and her three brothers[12] were raised as members of the Church. She attended Beaver Country Day School in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts,[13] and graduated from Watertown High School.[14]
Career
Acting
1992–1997: Beginnings and breakthrough
Dushku came to the attention of casting agents when she was ten years old. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the 1992 romantic drama film That Night. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl, alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, in the drama film This Boy's Life. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in the action spy film True Lies.[15]
She had roles as Piper Reeves in the short film Fishing with George (1994), as Cat in the television film Journey (1995),[16] as Paul Reiser's daughter in the romantic comedy film Bye Bye Love (1995), and as Cindy Johnson in the comedy drama film Race the Sun (1996).
1998–2002: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and recognition
Dushku planned to attend Suffolk University in Boston, where her mother taught,[12][17] but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a television show starring another of his clients, Sarah Michelle Gellar. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local Claire's to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part of Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[17] When she began her work on the series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive emancipation to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of the show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.[12] Though initially planned as a three-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four and for the last five episodes of the series. She also appeared in the spin-off series Angel.[12]
As an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from prisoners. She said:
I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting things that you don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures – "Oh, here's a picture of me before I was incarcerated!" – and there's some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a mustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy. Way more creepy than Buffy.[18]
In 2000, Dushku starred in the hit cheerleader comedy Bring It On.[5] She followed that up with Soul Survivors,[5] which reunited her with her Race the Sun co-star Casey Affleck. In 2001, she appeared in The New Guy with DJ Qualls and in City by the Sea with Robert De Niro and James Franco.[5] The latter film garnered attention from a wider adult audience and several good reviews. The same year, Kevin Smith invited Dushku to be a part of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.[5]
2003–2008: Tru Calling and subsequent roles
In 2003, Dushku starred in the horror film Wrong Turn[5] and The Kiss, an independent comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, Tru Calling, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant withdrawn, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue, where she discovers her power to "re-live" the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer about Faith.
She has had many roles as a "bad girl" in films. In an interview with Maxim in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, "It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting."[19]
Dushku starred in the Off-Broadway play Dog Sees God in December 2005. The play was based on the Peanuts comic strip, with Dushku playing a character symbolizing Lucy Van Pelt. She quit in February 2006 along with other members of the cast amid rumors of abuse by the producer, which were later dismissed.
She played the lead character on Nurses, a hospital comedy-drama for Fox. This was the second Fox pilot in which she was cast, but not broadcast.[20]
She appeared in the Simple Plan music video "I'm Just a Kid" as the band's love interest, as well as Nickelback's video for "Rockstar".
On October 1, 2005, she announced at Wizard World Boston that shooting had begun for Nobel Son in which she would star with Alan Rickman, Danny DeVito, and Bill Pullman. The film was released at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[21] Another project released in 2007 was On Broadway, an independent film filmed in Boston. It received positive reviews,[22] with a few of them highlighting Dushku's performance.
Dushku has had roles in five video games. She voiced the role of Yumi Sawamura in the English-language version of Yakuza for the PlayStation 2, which was published and developed by Sega, and released in September 2006. Dushku also stars as Shaundi, one of the lead characters in Saints Row 2, which was developed by Volition, Inc. and published by THQ.[23] It was released in North America on October 14, 2008, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. She was the voice talent for the role of Rubi Malone, the main character in the game WET. She appeared at Spike TV's 2008 Video Game Awards in December 2008.[4] Danielle Nicolet took over the role of Shaundi in Saints Row: The Third. She also voiced Megan McQueen in Champion Mode of the 2011 video game Fight Night Champion.
Variety announced on August 2, 2006, that Dushku would co-star with Macaulay Culkin in Sex and Breakfast, a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. A reviewer described Dushku as "charming" and giving the character "an edge".[24] The film was released in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and on DVD on January 22, 2008. She starred in Open Graves, a 2008 horror-thriller about a satanic game co-starring Mike Vogel. She played the main character in The Thacker Case and The Alphabet Killer, both thrillers based on real-life events, one of them directed by Rob Schmidt, with whom she had worked on Wrong Turn. Both films were released in 2008.[25] The Alphabet Killer contains Dushku's first topless scene.[26] The film earned mixed reviews, but reviewers praised Dushku's performance, commenting "Eliza Dushku commands the screen but cannot reconcile the script's conflicted and increasingly idiotic agendas."[27] She appeared in Bottle Shock, a drama about Napa valley wine.[3] The film was directed by Randall Miller, who helmed Nobel Son.[3][28]
2009–present: Dollhouse and other work
On August 26, 2007, Dushku signed a development deal with Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox. Under the pact, the network and the studio would develop projects tailor-made for the actress as well as approach her with existing pitches and scripts.[29]
Subsequently, it was announced on October 31 that Dushku had lured Joss Whedon, of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, back to TV, to create a television series called Dollhouse. Dushku produced the show and played the main character, 'Echo'. It aired on Fox during the 2008–09 TV season. In an interview, Dushku talked about how Dollhouse and her reconnection with Whedon came about:
I invited Joss Whedon to lunch after I did the business deal with Fox. We'd had a cool relationship in the past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I was a little bit of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.[30]
Dushku described Whedon as "my favorite genius ... favorite friend ... big brother ... and the only person out here I've ever wholeheartedly trusted, because he's never let me down."[31] Dollhouse was renewed for a second season. The producers cited their confidence in the strength of Whedon's fan base and high DVR numbers as their reasons for keeping the show. Fox cancelled Dollhouse on November 11, 2009. The show officially wrapped filming on the second and final season on Decembe

Moses Anthony Davis (born on 22 August 1973),[3] professionally known as Beenie Man, is a Jamaican  dancehall deejay.[4]
Biography
Davis was born in the Waterhouse district of Kingston in 1973.[3][5][6] He was involved in the music industry from a young age, started toasting at the age of five, and was encouraged by his uncle Sydney Knowles, who played drums for Jimmy Cliff.[7][8] He won the Tastee Talent contest in 1981,[5][9] and Radio DJ Barry G introduced him to local sound system operators, who helped to establish the popularity of the young deejay, who became known as Beenie Man.[7] He recorded his debut single, "Too Fancy", with record producer Henry "Junjo" Lawes in 1981, with Lawes also including him on the 1983 album Junjo Presents Two Big Sounds alongside established stars such as Dillinger, Fathead, and Ringo.[5] His debut album, The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder was produced by Bunny Lee and released in 1983,[10] his first hit single following the same year with the Winston Holness-produced "Over the Sea".[5] In 1984 Beenie Man recorded some material with Barrington Levy (released ten years later), but his music career was put on hold while he finished school, and spent time travelling to the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.[5]
1990s return
Beenie Man continued performing and honed his craft beside the then dominant Dancehall figures including Ninjaman, Admiral Bailey and Shabba Ranks. He found his artistic home at the Shocking Vibes studio where he continued to record singles with only moderate success in the early 1990s. His career gained momentum after a performance at the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1992, and a rivalry with Bounty Killer began the following year after Beenie Man was accused of stealing Bounty Killer's style and catch phrases.[5] The rivalry was captured on the 1994 album Guns Out, with the two artists settling the feud with a soundclash.[5] Beenie Man had his first number one single in Jamaica in 1993 with "Matie" (Produced by Ephraim Barrett, Donovan and Dave Mills on the Shelly Power Records label) and he won the DJ of the Year Award the same year, the first of eight consecutive awards.[9]
International stardom
Partially as a result of prodding from his producers, Sly and Robbie, with whom he recorded cover versions of Bob Marley's "Crazy Baldhead" and "No Woman No Cry" in 1994, the latter a Jamaican chart-topper, Beenie Man converted to the Rastafari movement, as did several of his contemporaries at the time, although in 2005 he stated "I have not converted. I was baptised an Ethiopian Orthodox and at the age of 10 I became a Judah Coptic."[5][8] In 1994, he was signed by Island Records and released the critically acclaimed album Blessed, which established his reputation internationally.[5] In 1995 he toured the UK and joined up again with Barrington Levy to record an updated jungle version of Levy's "Under Mi Sensi".[5]
In 1995, Beenie Man collaborated with Dennis Brown and Triston Palma to release Three Against War and Mad Cobra and Lieutenant Stitchie on Mad Cobra Meets Lt. Stitchie & Beenie Man. He also collaborated with Lady Saw on "Healing", Sanchez on "Refugee", and Michael Prophet on "Gun 'n' Bass", further establishing his reputation.[5] He took another step up the ladder in 1996, releasing the seminal Maestro, produced by Patrick Roberts and shot him to UK fame. During the period from the mid to late 1990s, Beenie Man dominated the Jamaican charts to the extent that he perhaps had a good claim to the crown of "Dancehall King", a title only bestowed previously on Yellowman in the early 1980s.
Beenie Man's first real break into the United States came in 1997. He heard an instrumental rhythm by an unknown producer named Jeremy Harding, and demanded to add his voice to the rhythm. So this was the birth of his first international hit; he recorded "Who Am I" and the single quickly went Gold. It opened the doors for the world to see a new reggae star in the pages of Newsweek and other major media outlets. The same year, Beenie Man topped the Jamaican singles chart with seven different singles.[5]
In 1998, Beenie Man headlined Reggae Sunsplash and signed to Virgin Records to release albums in the United States. His first American offering was The Doctor (1998). During the late 1990s, Beenie Man began his conquest of America with the hits, "Romie", "Who Am I", and "Girls Dem Sugar", which featured American R&B singer, Mýa.  During this time he received an impressive number of international music awards including a MOBO Award for Best International Reggae Act in 1998,[11] while remaining at the top of the local charts. In 2000, Beenie Man released Art & Life, which featured Arturo Sandoval and Wyclef Jean (The Fugees), for which received a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album.[5] In the same year he co-produced (with Wyclef Jean) the debut album by actor Steven Seagal.[5] Beenie Man, like many dancehall artists, is outspoken on a number of social issues, as exemplified by songs such as "Steve Biko" and "Murderer".[12][13][14]
In 2002, he had a sizeable hit with a duet with Janet Jackson called "Feel It Boy", but his biggest break in America came in early 2004 with the release of a remix of "Dude", featuring guest vocals by fellow Jamaican Ms. Thing as well as rhymes by Shawnna. He thus cemented his fan base on both sides of the Atlantic.
He had hits in the UK in 1998 with "Who am I" (#10), in 2003 with "Street Life" (#13) and "Feel It Boy" (UK #9), a duet with Janet Jackson, and in 2004 with "Dude" (#7) and "King of the Dancehall" (#14).[15] Also in 2004, The Associated Press observed that Beenie Man had "become a name-brand artist worldwide" and called him "king of the dancehall reggae scene".[16]
He was also a judge for the 6th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.[17]
In April 2008, it was announced that Beenie Man was to co-write and star in the film Kingston.[18]
In October 2010, Beenie Man came out with the EP I'm Drinking Rum and Red Bull, which included four songs, "Im drinking Rum and Red Bull", "I'm Okay", and two versions of "Stack and Pile". He later released the full album on 28 February 2011. "Im Drinking Rum and Red Bull" features Future Fambo.
In April 2009, Beenie Man signed with Brookland Entertainment, a new record label formed by Eric Nicks and The Trackmasters, in preparation to release his new album The Legend Returns, the music video for the release of his new single "Gimme Gimme" being shot in Canada on 18 April 2009. The song "Let's Go" was released on the Overproof Riddim compilation album in 2011.
In 2014, Beenie Man and long-term rival Bounty Killer put aside their differences and recorded a single together, "Legendary".[21] The two performed a well-received Verzuz battle together on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on 23 May 2020.[22][23] Around that time, Vibe described them as "two of the most legendary icons in dancehall."[24]
Personal life
Beenie Man married Michelle "D'Angel" Downer on 22 August 2006.[25] In June 2007, Beenie Man separated from his wife. In March 2010, they released a duet single entitled "You Are My First", although at the time they were separated.[25]
The couple filed for divorce in 2011,  around the same time Shelly-Ann Fraser {now Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce} and Jason Pryce (who is now her husband) were getting married. [26] All legalities were completed in 2019. [27]
Controversy
Anti-gay lyrics
The lyrics to some of his songs have been criticised for inciting the murder of homosexuals.[28] He was removed from the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards after protests by gay-rights activists.[29] That same year, Beenie Man was stopped by police at Heathrow Airport in London, after the cancellation of a concert in the United Kingdom.[30] He then issued an apology for the lyrics through his record company.[31] In 2005, gay rights group OutRage! suspended their opposition to Beenie Man after he agreed not to play songs featuring homophobic lyrics, and he performed in London that year.[32] The following year, he claimed his lyrics were anti-paedophilia, not against consensual homosexual relationships.[33]
In 2007, it was reported that Beenie Man, along with several other artists, had signed the Reggae Compassionate Act, an agreement to cease performances of anti-gay material.[34] He later denied that he had signed the act.[35]
As of 2010, protests have continued to cause cancellations of his concerts in some countries, including New Zealand, Belgium and the Netherlands.[36][37][38]
In 2012, Beenie Man apologized to the gay community for his earlier homophobic lyrics: "Let me make this clear and straight.[39] I have nothing against no one. I respect each and every human being, regardless of which race or creed, regardless of which religious belief you believe in, and regardless of which sexual preference you are, including gays and lesbian people. I respect all human...Please I am begging you do not have me up for some songs I wrote a long time ago. I love each and every one and am just begging each and everyone to do the same."[40][41] In other interviews, however, he was quoted making statements such as "I never apologized" and "I told them to leave us alone, to try to understand where we are coming from."[42][43] In 2015 prior to coming to New Zealand for a concert, GayNZ.com news site asked Beenie Man about the homophobic lyrics in his earlier songs. He hung up the telephone without answering.[44]
Yellowman feud
In 2006, veteran deejay Yellowman publicly chastised Beenie Man for his hit "King of the Dancehall". Known as "King Yellowman" since the 1980s, the deejay took exception to Beenie Man proclaiming himself "king", as well as comments Beenie made regarding his appearance. Regarding the title of "king", Yellowman stated: "Him trying to make people feel like him was here before me, but him never deh here before me, because dem planning to do dem official crowning them claim say is an official crowning but dem a use some a di media as some of them organisation ...".[45] Beenie Man made comments later that year in German-based Riddim Magazine, comparing Bounty Killer to Yellowman in appearance: "Bounty Killer is a great artiste and he's ugly, too. He's got a rough thing about him, Jamaicans lik

Kimberly Jean Burrell[1] (born August 26, 1972) is an American gospel singer, songwriter, and pastor from Houston, Texas.
Early life
Born Kimberly Jean Burrell on August 26, 1972, in Houston, Texas,[2] Burrell was one of four children born to Julius Burrell Jr., a pastor, and Helen Ruth Graham, an evangelist singer in The Church of God in Christ.[1] As a youth, Burrell began performing with Reverend James Cleveland's GMWA Youth Mass Choir (also known as Rev. James Cleveland's Kids).[3]
Career
1989–2003
Burrell's performances continued with Trinity Temple Full Gospel Mass Choir of Dallas and The Inspirational Sounds Mass Choir of Houston.[3] In 1996, she was a featured singer on the reprise of "Jesus Paid It All" on Ricky Dillard & New G's album Worked It Out. Her first independent album, Try Me Again, was released on the Texas-based boutique label Pearl Records in 1995. This led to her being signed to Tommy Boy Gospel and releasing another album, Everlasting Life (1998), produced by Asaph Alexander Ward. The album peaked at #10 on the Billboard Gospel Charts.[4] Burrell recorded Live In Concert, a live album in November 2000 at the annual COGIC Holy Convocation in Memphis, Tennessee. The album was released in 2001. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Album in 2002. Though Tommy Boy Gospel closed shortly after the release of Live In Concert, by 2002, she had signed a recording contract with Elektra Records.[5] Under this contract she recorded only a guest appearance on the all-star gospel track "Higher Ground", which first appeared as a bonus track on Missy Elliott's album Miss E... So Addictive[6] and was later featured on Karen Clark Sheard's 2nd Chance album. Burrell has continued to perform live and to collaborate with other artists. Though only intermittently active as a recording artist, she established and hosts the annual Ephesians 4 conference, a workshop for performing artists.
2004–present
In 2004, Burrell was a guest performer along with Kelly Price on R. Kelly's "3-Way Phone Call" playing the part of Price's "prayer partner" in the soap opera-like song.[7] She appeared in George Clinton's original song "Mathematics of Love" on Clinton's 2008 album of covers, George Clinton and Some Gangsters of Love.[8] Burrell released her first studio album in 11 years, No Ways Tired, on April 7, 2009, through Shanachie Records.[9] The album features covers of classic gospel songs like "My Faith Looks Up To Thee," "What A Friend We Have In Jesus," "O Lamb Of God" and "I Surrender All," as well as the classic James Cleveland song after which the album is named.[10][11] Burrell sang "I see a Victory" with Pharrell Williams for the soundtrack to the feature film Hidden Figures (2016).[12]
In December 2016, a video surfaced showing Burrell preaching a sermon at the Love & Liberty Fellowship Church.[13][14] In that sermon, she called people who engage in homosexual acts "perverted" and said they had been deceived by the "homosexual spirit."[15][16] She also warned that people who "play with" homosexual sin would "die from it" in 2017.[17] In response to considerable criticism, Burrell said that she makes "no excuses or apologies" for the sermon, adding "I love you, and God loves you, but he hates the sin in you and me."[18] Shortly after the video of the sermon surfaced, The Ellen DeGeneres Show canceled Burrell's scheduled appearance,[19] as did the BMI Trailblazers of Gospel Music event, where she was removed as an honoree.[20] Her radio talk show, Bridging the Gap with Kim Burrell, was canceled by Texas Southern University.[21]

Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn (20 June 1909 – 14 October 1959) was an Australian actor who achieved worldwide fame during the Golden Age of Hollywood. He was known for his romantic swashbuckler roles, frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland, and reputation for his womanising and hedonistic personal life. His most notable roles include Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), which was later named by the American Film Institute as the 18th greatest hero in American film history, the lead role in Captain Blood (1935), Major Geoffrey Vickers in The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), and the hero in a number of Westerns such as Dodge City (1939), Santa Fe Trail, Virginia City (both 1940), and San Antonio (1945).
Early life
Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn[1] was born on 20 June 1909 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point, Tasmania. His father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but shortly after marrying Theodore at St John's Church of England, Birchgrove, Sydney, on 23 January 1909,[2] she changed her first name to Marelle.[3] Flynn described his mother's family as "seafaring folk"[4] and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated. Both of his parents were Australian-born of Irish, English and Scottish descent. Despite Flynn's claims,[5] the evidence indicates that he was not descended from any of the Bounty mutineers.[6]
Flynn received his early schooling in Hobart. Future World Correspondence Chess Champion Cecil Purdy was one of his classmates. He attended The Hutchins School, Hobart College, The Friends School and Albuera Street Primary School and was expelled from each one. He made one of his first appearances as a performer in 1918, aged nine, when he served as a page boy to Enid Lyons in a queen carnival. In her memoirs, Lyons recalled Flynn as "a dashing figure—a handsome boy of nine with a fearless, somewhat haughty expression, already showing that sang-froid for which he was later to become famous throughout the civilized world". She further noted: "Unfortunately Errol at the age of nine did not yet possess that magic for extracting money from the public which so distinguished his career as an actor. Our cause gained no apparent advantage from his presence in my entourage; we gained only third place in a field of seven."[7]
From 1923 to 1925, Flynn attended the South West London College, a private boarding school in Barnes, London.[8]
In 1926, he returned to Australia to attend Sydney Church of England Grammar School (known as "Shore"),[9] where he was the classmate of a future Australian prime minister, John Gorton.[10] His formal education ended with his expulsion from Shore for theft,[11] although he later claimed it was for a sexual encounter with the school's laundress.[12]
After being dismissed from a job as a junior clerk with a Sydney shipping company for pilfering petty cash, he went to Papua New Guinea at the age of eighteen, seeking his fortune in tobacco planting and gold mining in the Morobe Goldfield.[13] He spent the next five years oscillating between living in New Guinea and Sydney.[11]
In January 1931, Flynn became engaged to Naomi Campbell-Dibbs, the youngest daughter of Robert and Emily Hamlyn (Brown) Campbell-Dibbs of Temora and Bowral, New South Wales. They did not marry.[14]
Early career
In the Wake of the Bounty
Australian filmmaker Charles Chauvel was making a film about the mutiny on the Bounty, In the Wake of the Bounty (1933), a combination of dramatic re-enactments of the mutiny and a documentary on present-day Pitcairn Island. Chauvel was looking for someone to play the role of Fletcher Christian. There are different stories about the way Flynn was cast. According to one, Chauvel saw his picture in an article about a yacht wreck involving Flynn.[15] The most popular account is that he was discovered by cast member John Warwick. The film was not a strong success at the box office, but Flynn's was the lead role, leading him to travel to Britain in late 1933 to pursue a career in acting.
Britain
Flynn got work as an extra in a film, I Adore You (1933), produced by Irving Asher for Warner Bros. He soon secured a job with the Northampton Repertory Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of Royal & Derngate), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. He performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival and in Glasgow, and briefly in London's West End.[16]
In 1934 Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after he threw a female stage manager down a stairwell. He returned to London. Asher cast him as the lead in Murder at Monte Carlo, a "quota quickie" made by Warner Brothers at their Teddington Studios in Middlesex. The movie was not widely seen (it is a lost film) but Asher was enthusiastic about Flynn's performance and cabled Warner Bros in Hollywood, recommending him for a contract. Executives agreed and Flynn was sent to Los Angeles.[17]
Hollywood
Flynn in the trailers for Captain Blood (1935) and The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)
On the ship from London, Flynn met (and eventually married) Lili Damita, an actress five years his senior whose contacts proved invaluable when Flynn arrived in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. publicity described him as an "Irish leading man of the London stage".[18]
His first appearance was a small role in The Case of the Curious Bride (1935). Flynn had two scenes, one as a corpse and one in flashback. His next part was slightly bigger, in Don't Bet on Blondes (1935), a B-picture screwball comedy.
Captain Blood
Warner Bros. was preparing a big budget swashbuckler, Captain Blood (1935), based on the 1922 novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz.
The studio originally intended to cast Robert Donat, but he turned down the part, afraid that his chronic asthma would make it impossible for him to perform the strenuous role.[19] Warners considered a number of other actors, including Leslie Howard and James Cagney, and also conducted screen tests of those they had under contract, like Flynn. The tests were impressive and Warners finally cast Flynn in the lead, opposite 19-year-old Olivia de Havilland. The resulting film was a magnificent success for the studio and gave birth to two new Hollywood stars and an on-screen partnership that would encompass eight films over six years.[20] The budget for Captain Blood was $1.242 million, and it made $1.357 million in the U.S. and $1.733 million overseas, meaning a huge profit for Warner Bros.[21]
Flynn had been selected to support Fredric March in Anthony Adverse (1936), but public response to Captain Blood was so enthusiastic that Warners instead reunited him with de Havilland and Curtiz in another adventure tale, this time set during the Crimean War, The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936). The film was given a slightly larger budget than Captain Blood, at $1.33 million, and it had a much higher box-office gross, earning $1.454 million in the US and $1.928 million overseas, making it Warner Bros.' No. 1 hit of 1936.[21]
Flynn asked for a different kind of role and so when ill health made Leslie Howard drop out of the screen adaptation of Lloyd C. Douglas' inspirational novel, Flynn got the lead role in Green Light (1937), playing a doctor searching for a cure for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.[22] The studio then put him back into another swashbuckler, replacing Patric Knowles as Miles Hendon in The Prince and the Pauper (1937). He appeared opposite Kay Francis in Another Dawn (1937), a melodrama set in a mythical British desert colony. Warners then gave Flynn his first starring role in a modern comedy, The Perfect Specimen (1937), with Joan Blondell, under the direction of Curtiz. Meanwhile, Flynn published his first book, Beam Ends (1937), an autobiographical account of his experiences sailing around Australia as a youth. He also travelled to Spain, in 1937, as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, in which he sympathised with the Republicans.[23][24]
The Adventures of Robin Hood
Flynn followed this with his most famous movie, The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), playing the title role, opposite de Havilland's Marian.[25] This movie was a global success. It was the 6th-top movie grosser of 1938.[26] It was also the studio's first large-budget colour film using the three-strip Technicolor process.[27] The budget for Robin Hood was the highest ever for a Warner Bros. production up to that point—$2.47 million—but it more than made back its costs and turned a huge profit as it grossed $2.343 million in the U.S. and $2.495 million overseas.[28]
It also received lavish praise from critics and became a world favourite; in 2019, Rotten Tomatoes summarised the critical consensus: "Errol Flynn thrills as the legendary title character, and the film embodies the type of imaginative family adventure tailor-made for the silver screen".[29] In 1995, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.[30] Years later, in a 2005 interview, de Havilland described how, during the filming, she decided to tease Flynn, whose wife was on the set and watching closely. De Havilland said, "And so we had one kissing scene, which I looked forward to with great delight. I remember I blew every take, at least six in a row, maybe seven, maybe eight, and we had to kiss all over again. And Errol Flynn got really rather uncomfortable, and he had, if I may say so, a little trouble with his tights."[31]
The final duel between Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) is a classic, echoing the battle on the beach in Captain Blood where Flynn also kills Rathbone's character after a long demonstration of fine swordplay, in that case choreographed by Ralph Faulkner. According to Faulkner's student, Tex Allen, "Faulkner had good material to work with. Veteran Basil Rathbone was a good fencer already, and Flynn, though new to the school of fence, was athletic and a quick learner".
The success of The Adventures of Robin Hood did little to convince the studio that their prize swashbuckler should be allowed to do other things, but Warners allowed Flynn to try

Usermaatre Heqamaatre Setepenamun Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. He was the second son of Ramesses III and became crown prince when his elder brother Amenherkhepshef died aged 15[4] in 1164 BC, when Ramesses was only 12 years old.[4][5] His promotion to crown prince:
is suggested by his appearance (suitably entitled) in a scene of the festival of Min at the Ramesses III temple at Karnak, which may have been completed by Year 22 [of his father's reign]. (the date is mentioned in the poem inscribed there)[4]
As his father's chosen successor, the prince employed three distinctive titles: "Hereditary Prince", "Royal scribe" and "Generalissimo." The latter two titles are mentioned in a text at the temple of Amenhotep III at Soleb[6] and all three titles appear on a lintel now in Florence, Italy.[7] As heir-apparent he took on increasing responsibilities; for instance, in Year 27 of his father's reign, he is depicted appointing a certain Amenemope to the important position of Third Prophet of Amun in the latter's TT 148 tomb.[8] Amenemope's Theban tomb also accords prince Ramesses all three of his aforementioned sets of royal titles.[9] Despite the 31-year reign of his father Ramesses III, Ramesses IV was only 21 when he became pharaoh.[4] His rule has been dated to 1155 to 1149 BC.
Family
It is now believed that Ramesses IV's mother was most likely Queen Tyti from recently discovered notes published in the 2010 issue of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology.[10] They reveal that Tyti—who was a king's daughter, a king's wife and a king's mother in her own right—was identified in Papyrus BM EA 10052 (i.e., the tomb-robbery papyri) to be a queen of Ramesses III, Ramesses IV's father. The 2010 JEA article authors—including Aidan Dodson—write that since Ramesses VI's mother is known to be a certain lady named Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis:
only Ramesses IV and Ramesses VIII remain as candidates [for the son of Tyti]. Given that Ramesses VIII only reigned briefly some 25 years after his father’s death, it is hardly likely that the decoration of QV52, with the mwt-nsw (i.e., king's mother) title intimately mixed with Tyti’s other titles, could have been delayed this late to refer to him. This leaves Ramesses IV as the only credible primary 'subject' of the mwt-nsw title in the tomb. As for which--if any--of the other sons of Ramesses III were borne to Tyti, no unequivocal data is available, other than the fact that Amenhirkhopeshef B, buried in QV55,[11] was ms n Hmt-nTr mwt-nTr Hmt-nsw-wrt, paralleling Tyti's titles so closely that he may with some confidence be proposed as her son.[12]
Thus, the identity of Ramesses IV's mother has been resolved in favour of Queen Tyti who was once erroneously thought to be the mother of another king in the mid-1980s: Ramesses XI.[13] Ramesses IV was succeeded to the throne by his 13-year-old[14] son Ramesses V.

Ramesses IV came to the throne in difficult circumstances. Ramesses III, his father, was assassinated by conspirators led by Tiye, one of his secondary wives, to establish Pentawer, her own son and Ramesses IV's half-brother, on the throne.[15] Ramesses IV, however, was able to secure himself on the throne, and had the conspirators arrested and executed.
At the start of his reign, the pharaoh initiated a substantial building program on the scale of Ramesses II by doubling the size of the work gangs at Deir el-Medina to a total of 120 men and dispatching numerous expeditions to the stone quarries of Wadi Hammamat and the turquoise mines of the Sinai.[16] The Great Rock stela of Ramesses IV at Wadi Hammamat records that the largest expedition—dated to his Year 3, third month of Shemu day 27—consisted of 8,368 men alone including 5,000 soldiers, 2,000 personnel of the Amun temples, 800 Apiru and 130 stonemasons and quarrymen under the personal command of the High Priest of Amun, Ramessesnakht.[17] The scribes who composed the text also noted that this figure included 900 men "who are dead and omitted from this list."[4] Consequently, once this omitted figure is included to the tally of 8,368 men who served in the Year 3 quarry expedition, a total of 900 men out of an original expedition of 8,368 men perished during this endeavour for a mortality rate of 10.7%. Some of the stones which were dragged 60 miles to the Nile from Wadi Hammamat weighed 40 tons or more.[18] Other Egyptian quarries including Aswan were located much closer to the Nile which enabled them to use barges to transport stones long distances.
Part of the king's program included the extensive enlargement of his father's Temple of Khonsu at Karnak and the construction of a large mortuary temple near the Temple of Hatshepsut. Ramesses IV also sent several expeditions to the turquoise mines in the Sinai; a total of four expeditions are known prior to his fourth year. The Serabit el-Khadim stela of the Royal Butler Sobekhotep states: "Year 3, third month of Shemu. His Majesty sent his favoured and beloved one, the confident of his lord, the Overseer of the Treasury of Silver and Gold, Chief of the Secrets of the august Palace, Sobekhotep, justified, to bring for him all that his heart desired of turquoise (on) his fourth expedition."[19] This expedition dates to either Ramesses III or IV's reign since Sobekhotep is attested in office until at least the reign of Ramesses V.[4] Ramesses IV's final venture to the turquoise mines of the Sinai is documented by the stela of a senior army scribe named Panufer. Panufer states that this expedition's mission was both to procure turquoise and to establish a cult chapel of king Ramesses IV at the Hathor temple of Serabit el-Khadim.[20] The stela reads:
Year 5, second month of Shomu [i.e., summer]. The sending by His Majesty <to> build the Mansion of Millions of Years of Ramesses IV in the temple of Hathor, Lady of Turquoise, by Panefer, the Scribe of the Commands of the Army, son of Pairy, justified.[21]
While little is known regarding the route that the mining missions took from Egypt to Serabit el-Khadim, A. J. Peden, who wrote a biography of Ramesses IV in 1994, states that there were "two obvious routes" to reach this site:
The first was a straightforward march from a Delta base, such as Memphis, east south-east and then south into Sinai. Surviving a march in this inhospitable land would have presented formidable logistical obstacles, perhaps forcing an alternative route to be adopted. This would involve a departure from the Delta to a site near the modern port of Suez. From here they could have proceeded by boat to the ports of Abu Zenima or El-Markha on the west coast of the Sinai peninsula and from there it is a short journey inland of only a day or two to the actual site of Serabit el-Khadim.[4]
Attestations
Ramesses IV is attested by his aforementioned building activity at Wadi Hammamat and Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai as well as several papyri and even one obelisk. The creation of a royal cult in the Temple of Hathor is known under his reign at Serabit el-Khadim while Papyrus Mallet (or P. Louvre 1050) dates to Years 3 and 4 of his reign.[4] Papyrus Mallet is a six column text dealing partly with agricultural affairs; its first column lists the prices for various commodities between Year 31 of Ramesses III until Year 3 of Ramesses IV.[4] The final four columns contain a memorandum of 2 letters composed by the Superintendent of Cattle of the Estate of Amen-Re, Bakenkhons, to several mid-level administrators and their subordinates.[4] Meanwhile, surviving monuments of Ramesses IV in the Delta consists of an obelisk recovered in Cairo and a pair of his cartouches found on a pylon gateway both originally from Heliopolis.[4]
The most important document to survive from this pharaoh's rule is Papyrus Harris I, which honours the life of his father, Ramesses III, by listing the latter's many accomplishments and gifts to the temples of Egypt, and the Turin papyrus, the earliest known geologic map. Ramesses IV was perhaps the last New Kingdom king to engage in large-scale monumental building after his father as "there was a marked decline in temple building even during the longer reigns of Ramesses IX and VI. The only apparent exception was the attempt of Ramesses V and VI to continue the vast and uncompleted mortuary temple of Ramesses IV at the Assasif."[4]

Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈkry.(j)ər]; 10 October 1825 – 14 July 1904), better known as Paul Kruger, was a South African politician. He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa, and State President of the South African Republic (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed Oom Paul ("Uncle Paul"), he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause—that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State—against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom, and remains a controversial figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero.
Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no education apart from the Bible. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.
Kruger was appointed Vice President in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned. He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880–1881. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a completely independent state.
Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886, "uitlanders" (foreigners) provided almost all of the South African Republic's tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer burghers retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger's attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in 1888, 1893 and 1898, and led to the Jameson Raid of 1895–1896 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the Heroes' Acre in Pretoria.
Early life
Family and childhood
Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the Steynsburg area of the Cape Colony, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801–1852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; née Steyn; 1806–1834).[2] The family was of Dutch-speaking Afrikaner background, of German, French Huguenot and Dutch stock.[2][3] Also counted amongst its ancestry was some Khoi blood, which came down to it from his ancestress Krotoa.[4] The Kruger paternal ancestors had been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Krüger, from Berlin, arrived in Cape Town as a 17-year-old soldier in the Dutch East India Company's service. Jacob's children dropped the umlaut from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin. Over the following generations, Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior.[2] His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards.[2] Kruger's great-granduncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of Swellendam that revolted against Company rule in 1795.[5]
Bulhoek, Kruger's birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie's home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in Cradock in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14.[n 1] A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul was born in 1825.[2] His first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used. The provenance of the third given name, Paulus, "was to remain rather a mystery", Johannes Meintjes wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, "and yet the boy was always called Paul."[2]
Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826.[2] Soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony.[7] His mother died when he was eight; his father Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis).[8] Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, the only education Kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father.[8] In adulthood, Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.[9]
Great Trek
In 1835 Casper Kruger, his father, and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the Caledon River, on the Cape Colony's far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814, when the Netherlands ceded it to Britain with the Convention of London. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the Great Trek—a mass migration by Dutch-speaking "Voortrekkers" north-east from the Cape to the land on the far side of the Orange and Vaal rivers.[10] Many Boers had been expressing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content. They had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape.[11]
A group of emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter passed through the Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer republic with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers.[12] Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey, the trekkers made improvised classrooms, marking them with reeds and grass. The more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.[13]
The Voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a branch from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors.[14][15] Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting, while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.[15]
During 1837 and 1838 Kruger's family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary Daniel Lindley, who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration.[16] The Zulu King Dingane concluded a land treaty with Potgieter. But he reconsidered and massacred first Piet Retief's party of settlers, then others at Weenen.[14] Kruger later recounted his family's group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing "children pinioned to their mothers' breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels". But "God heard our prayer", he recalled, and "we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack ... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game."[17]
Because of the attacks, the Krugers returned to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that forced Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father settled at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal.[14] In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as the Day of the Vow.[n 2]
Burgher
Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two 6,000-acre (24 km2) farms—one for crops and one for grazing—upon becoming enfranchised burghers at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at the farm Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg in the Magaliesberg area.[14] Kruger later became the owner of a piece of farmland named Waterkloof, on 30 September 1842.[20] This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in Potchefstroom in 1842.[21] The same year Kruger was elected a deputy field cornet—"a singular honour at seventeen", Meintjes comments.[22] This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior commissioned officer.[2
